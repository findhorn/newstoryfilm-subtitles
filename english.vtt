00:10.500 --> 00:13.150
13 billion years
ago the universe

00:13.150 --> 00:15.640
exploded into
existence, expanded out

00:15.640 --> 00:18.360
in every direction for
approximately a billion years,

00:18.360 --> 00:22.220
swirled itself into
100 trillion galaxies.

00:22.220 --> 00:24.230
Galaxies that
formed new elements

00:24.230 --> 00:25.700
in the hearts of their stars.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.140
Stars that exploded
with new element

00:28.140 --> 00:31.300
rich clouds of stellar
nebulae that could then

00:31.300 --> 00:33.350
swirl back into
second generation

00:33.350 --> 00:35.290
stars with planets around them.

00:35.290 --> 00:37.830
Planets with the inner
genius and creativity

00:37.830 --> 00:40.600
that they could bring forth
oceans and atmosphere,

00:40.600 --> 00:44.000
the first cells of life, all
of the creatures that we know.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.180
Every civilization, or every
culture, has a mythology.

00:47.180 --> 00:50.180
I remember the old story.
It goes like this—

00:50.590 --> 00:52.290
do you want to you hear this?

00:52.290 --> 00:53.830
It goes like this.

00:53.830 --> 00:56.480
That answers the basic
questions: Who are you?

00:56.480 --> 00:57.830
What is a human being?

00:57.830 --> 00:59.310
What's important in life?

00:59.310 --> 01:01.400
How does change
happen in the world?

01:01.400 --> 01:02.450
Where do we come from?

01:02.450 --> 01:04.200
Where are we going?

01:04.200 --> 01:09.720
The sky father had an affair
with the woman who is the sea.

01:09.720 --> 01:14.440
And there life began as
the single celled organism,

01:14.440 --> 01:15.980
the coral polyp.

01:15.980 --> 01:18.820
The Vedic science
story starts out

01:18.820 --> 01:21.640
the universe is consciousness
which slows down

01:21.640 --> 01:23.930
into matter and
everything therefore

01:23.930 --> 01:26.610
evolves within that
consciousness field.

01:26.610 --> 01:29.420
Life is a hoop.

01:29.420 --> 01:35.640
And every single life form
has one place on this hoop.

01:35.640 --> 01:38.880
And the five fingered ones
have the tremendous honour

01:38.880 --> 01:42.400
of being one part of that hoop.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.580
One of the problems
with the old story

01:44.580 --> 01:46.360
within Western
culture is that it’s

01:46.360 --> 01:48.340
perpetuated a
sense of separation

01:48.340 --> 01:50.590
between humans and the
planet, between humans

01:50.590 --> 01:51.670
and the natural world.

01:51.670 --> 01:55.930
We are one with Mother Earth,
we are one with the cosmos,

01:55.930 --> 01:57.800
we are one with the universe.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.470
There is never a disconnection.

02:00.470 --> 02:04.090
And the world is
the way it is today

02:04.090 --> 02:08.840
because of the stories we have
communicated to each other.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.794
Stories are the
library of humanity.

02:10.794 --> 02:12.420
And we need to refer
to them because

02:12.420 --> 02:15.480
we've, in essence,
captured all the wisdom we

02:15.480 --> 02:16.880
have in our stories.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.550
But we must be careful
what we wish for.

02:19.550 --> 02:25.000
For every story limits as much
as it illumines and defines.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.980
Western science
started out with a story

02:27.980 --> 02:32.560
of a non-living, meaningless,
purposeless universe.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.970
It then discovered entropy.
It said it’s all running down.

02:35.970 --> 02:38.040
Okay, this is the
bleakest creation story

02:38.040 --> 02:40.820
anyone ever thought up.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.057
It’s all a question of story.

02:43.057 --> 02:44.890
We are in trouble just
now because we do not

02:44.890 --> 02:46.590
have a good story.

02:46.590 --> 02:49.082
We are in between stories.

02:49.082 --> 02:52.800
♪ There are
many, there are many,

02:52.800 --> 02:54.492
♪ there are many voices calling.

02:58.428 --> 03:04.990
♪ Who can hear the mother,
hear the mother crying.

03:08.910 --> 03:13.320
♪ Whoa come on now, whoa
it’s time, it’s time

03:13.320 --> 03:15.280
♪ to care for Earth.

03:18.220 --> 03:23.610
♪ Whoa come on now, whoa
it’s time, it’s time

03:23.610 --> 03:25.570
♪ to care for Earth.

03:29.351 --> 03:30.850
The thought of
Thomas Berry who was

03:30.850 --> 03:33.470
an American ecological
and cosmological thinker

03:33.470 --> 03:33.990
and writer.

03:33.990 --> 03:36.020
And when I encountered
the work of Thomas Berry,

03:36.020 --> 03:38.530
and then I had the opportunity
to study with Thomas Berry

03:38.530 --> 03:40.530
and have him as a
mentor for 20 years,

03:40.530 --> 03:42.900
he was talking about
the power of worldview.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.320
He wrote an essay in 1978
called “The New Story“

03:45.320 --> 03:48.720
in which he said it’s
all a question of story.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.610
We are in trouble just
now because we do not

03:50.610 --> 03:51.610
have a good story.

03:59.050 --> 04:05.900
We have come to believe that
nature is separate from us,

04:05.900 --> 04:08.706
and we are separate from nature.

04:08.706 --> 04:13.520
Nature’s out there, and we
can do what we like to nature.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.540
We can cut down the rainforests.

04:15.540 --> 04:18.720
We can put animals
in factory farms

04:18.720 --> 04:20.540
and slaughter them as we like.

04:20.540 --> 04:22.720
We can overfish the oceans.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.370
We can pollute the rivers.

04:24.370 --> 04:26.500
We can pollute the water
and change climate.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.810
We can do what we like.

04:27.810 --> 04:30.660
But we are somehow
superior to nature.

04:30.660 --> 04:33.350
We are somehow rulers of nature.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.050
That’s the old story.

04:35.050 --> 04:39.050
The strangest of all beliefs
which is that as humans on this

04:39.050 --> 04:44.180
planet we cannot help but
destroy the planet while we are

04:44.180 --> 04:45.160
living on it.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.550
We are putting so much
pressure on the environment,

04:48.550 --> 04:51.170
so much pressure on
poor people, so much

04:51.170 --> 04:52.950
pressure on the atmosphere.

04:52.950 --> 04:53.730
Global warming.

04:53.730 --> 04:54.400
Climate change.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.650
So our glaciers were
receding very fast.

04:57.650 --> 05:02.080
And the weather changed very
quickly in the last three years

05:02.080 --> 05:03.170
for us.

05:03.170 --> 05:06.170
Even it snowed in
the desert this year.

05:06.170 --> 05:10.430
With the mining of oil,
with the shale gas industry,

05:10.430 --> 05:11.070
fracking.

05:11.070 --> 05:15.840
Chainsaws, and bulldozers,
and chemical sprays.

05:15.840 --> 05:22.830
The lungs of our planet
being destroyed at a rate

05:22.830 --> 05:26.860
that leaves one breathless.

05:26.860 --> 05:31.310
All of this for the resources
for which without we would not

05:31.310 --> 05:35.840
have laptops, we would
not have cell phones,

05:35.840 --> 05:39.230
and the many gadgets
that we depend on today.

05:39.230 --> 05:41.460
We live in a very,
very brutal system.

05:41.460 --> 05:45.020
Not only brutal toward
those that we can easily

05:45.020 --> 05:50.330
see as victims, but equally
brutal toward the perpetrators.

05:50.330 --> 05:52.440
Otherwise, how would they
become the perpetrators?

05:52.440 --> 05:55.980
You know, what has to happen
to a human being for them

05:55.980 --> 05:58.300
to do the things that
people do to each other?

05:58.300 --> 06:03.980
Every four seconds a child
in Africa is starving.

06:07.614 --> 06:14.540
In our normality,
all of us, a girl,

06:14.540 --> 06:22.700
her genital parts are cut so
she does not enjoy sexuality.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.920
A woman is raped.

06:24.920 --> 06:29.060
A woman in my country is killed
because her husband or brother

06:29.060 --> 06:33.570
is jealous—what’s called
the honour of the family.

06:33.570 --> 06:37.680
In the normality, a
field of Pachamama

06:37.680 --> 06:41.040
is spread with chemicals,
and another part of her body

06:41.040 --> 06:42.700
is getting rotten.

06:42.700 --> 06:47.120
People are being
killed as we speak here

06:47.120 --> 06:53.370
for diamonds, gold, copper,
cobalt, coltan, silver,

06:53.370 --> 06:54.620
uranium.

06:54.620 --> 06:58.020
We live in a for-profit
world, essentially.

06:58.020 --> 07:00.850
It’s a market based
economy, and success

07:00.850 --> 07:03.580
is measured by your
return on investment,

07:03.580 --> 07:07.180
by your market share, by
your level of profitability,

07:07.180 --> 07:08.660
by margins, all of these things.

07:08.660 --> 07:09.690
That’s the deal.

07:09.690 --> 07:13.140
Just the narrative
to just get a job,

07:13.140 --> 07:16.610
and make money, and play
the capitalistic game,

07:16.610 --> 07:19.380
it’s not working
for young people.

07:19.380 --> 07:22.140
Today’s young people don’t
want to just work, work, work.

07:22.140 --> 07:24.810
All the kids, we were
at war against the teachers,

07:24.810 --> 07:26.600
they were at war against us.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.880
And it was all based on
massive harm and destruction,

07:29.880 --> 07:33.650
psychological and
violent, physical harm.

07:33.650 --> 07:35.350
Because when you
grew up in gangs

07:35.350 --> 07:39.130
in a very angry,
controlled environment,

07:39.130 --> 07:42.920
I had to learn to fight
and defend myself in ways

07:42.920 --> 07:44.480
I didn’t realise I had to.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.230
Because I was black, you
know, I had this history

07:47.230 --> 07:49.750
that I had to fight for that
I did not know anything about.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.650
And we’re born with
this perception,

07:52.650 --> 08:00.180
I would call it a knowing,
that gets beaten out of us.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.610
And that’s a very
painful process,

08:01.610 --> 08:04.525
to be ejected from
a magical world.

08:04.525 --> 08:10.960
♪ Wait a minute,
is that the ocean I smell?

08:10.960 --> 08:16.974
♪ And my heart moves to the
rhythm of a big blue swell.

08:16.974 --> 08:23.446
♪ From the top of the atmosphere,
to the deep I dive,

08:23.446 --> 08:28.188
♪ and I know that our
children will survive.

08:29.746 --> 08:35.318
♪ There are things that we
can count on in our lives.

08:35.318 --> 08:37.748
♪ Wait a minute.

08:52.217 --> 08:55.199
To the story of our future.

09:00.710 --> 09:07.330
The future records written
in the fossils of this planet

09:07.330 --> 09:14.102
will actually record a time
of great turning, a time

09:14.102 --> 09:15.310
of incredible self awareness.

09:26.120 --> 09:31.330
This event, of New
Story Summit at Findhorn,

09:31.330 --> 09:34.590
is an expression of awakening.

09:34.590 --> 09:36.740
An expression of
rising consciousness,

09:36.740 --> 09:38.110
changing consciousness.

09:38.110 --> 09:41.440
A 7-day experience
of being mutually held

09:41.440 --> 09:44.190
in a radically different
way of seeing the world.

09:44.190 --> 09:46.860
The moment this
New Story Summit

09:46.860 --> 09:51.130
was announced, within a
month it was sold out.

09:51.130 --> 09:54.040
Please know that as we go
into this journey this week,

09:54.040 --> 09:58.680
we are walking in a pre-prepared
field of potentially

09:58.680 --> 10:00.260
transformational energy.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.060
The original impulse
for the summit

10:06.060 --> 10:08.370
was to see what
would happen if we

10:08.370 --> 10:11.480
got a group of people
together who are all carrying

10:11.480 --> 10:14.170
a thread of the new story.

10:14.170 --> 10:16.850
Not try to reach
a single story,

10:16.850 --> 10:19.900
but figure out what
are our common values?

10:19.900 --> 10:23.480
What are the values we are going
to base all those stories on?

10:23.480 --> 10:28.000
Love, and cooperation,
and friendly competition.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.400
We are consciously stepping
out of our comfort zone.

10:32.400 --> 10:36.140
And we do this through
creative being together,

10:36.140 --> 10:42.520
through combining all
kinds of old and new wisdom

10:42.520 --> 10:45.400
by combining the
youngest and the oldest.

10:45.400 --> 10:49.100
This isn’t just an
excursion from reality, but

10:49.100 --> 10:51.090
this is a glimpse of the future.

10:51.090 --> 10:55.170
It is amazing that people from
forty-five different countries

10:55.170 --> 10:56.510
have come to this event.

10:56.510 --> 11:01.240
My name is Visolela
Namises. I am from Namibia.

[Introduction in own language]

11:13.800 --> 11:15.380
[Introduction in own language]

11:15.380 --> 11:19.850
My name’s Vicki Downey and I’m from
Tesugeh Oweengeh in New Mexico.

11:19.850 --> 11:26.010
[Introduction in own language]

11:26.010 --> 11:29.980
It’s really a privilege to
be here with you, particularly

11:29.980 --> 11:33.850
to be the only
non-physical person

11:33.850 --> 11:36.120
present, which I
suppose is fitting

11:36.120 --> 11:38.840
given what I want to talk about.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.520
I always come into these
events with a high amount

11:41.520 --> 11:43.920
of expectation and
this has just blown me

11:43.920 --> 11:47.000
away in terms of the
spaces that we’ve been in.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.120
What flourished
here over the years

11:49.120 --> 11:53.962
is what you see now, a
living, working community.

11:53.962 --> 11:55.670
I want you to know
that this event is not

11:55.670 --> 11:58.850
happening at a conference centre
where everything done for you

11:58.850 --> 12:02.090
is done by paid employees.

12:02.090 --> 12:04.440
The people who are harvesting
the food, the people who

12:04.440 --> 12:07.210
are cooking in the kitchen,
the people who are cleaning up,

12:07.210 --> 12:10.930
the office staff, everybody
here is part of this community.

12:10.930 --> 12:14.440
We’re all drawn here by
this impulse to co-create,

12:14.440 --> 12:17.350
to be of world service,
and to deeply listen.

12:17.350 --> 12:20.800
Our inner attunement and
cooperation with nature

12:20.800 --> 12:24.600
created an atmosphere,
a powerful note that

12:24.600 --> 12:27.020
attracted many on inner levels.

12:27.020 --> 12:30.280
We’re certainly not
perfect by any extent

12:30.280 --> 12:32.990
of the imagination. All
the stuff that happens

12:32.990 --> 12:34.960
in the world is happening here.

12:34.960 --> 12:38.130
But why I like to
be here is that I

12:38.130 --> 12:42.260
like what we do with that,
how we deal with all that.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.530
We were asked to
have no publicity

12:44.530 --> 12:48.830
and invite no one here, and
yet people kept arriving.

12:48.830 --> 12:52.050
When I first arrived in
Findhorn 40 years ago,

12:52.050 --> 12:58.160
I knew the community had a
gift to give the larger world

12:58.160 --> 13:01.450
and that’s why I stayed.

13:01.450 --> 13:06.040
40 years later, I still feel
that way, indeed even more so,

13:06.040 --> 13:08.536
in part, at least,
because of this is event.

13:08.536 --> 13:09.910
These kind of
gatherings give me

13:09.910 --> 13:12.930
hope that there’s so much
energy and possibility,

13:12.930 --> 13:16.090
to host our pain,
to host our joy,

13:16.090 --> 13:18.750
and to bring all of those things
into a weaving that may really

13:18.750 --> 13:22.070
serve us as a humanity
and serve this Earth.

13:22.070 --> 13:28.070
I’ve seen people of many
nations grieving together.

13:31.240 --> 13:35.220
And I’ve seen people of many
nations dancing together.

13:38.172 --> 13:43.700
And I've seen indigenous
people from many nations

13:43.700 --> 13:50.970
coming together and
taking us in a ceremony,

13:50.970 --> 14:04.160
weaving so beautifully, no
ego, sharing feathers, fully

14:04.160 --> 14:08.045
in service of our
grieving of our hearts.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.520
Thank you for the simplicity.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.760
Thank you for the co-creation.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.094
Thank you for our co-creation.

14:24.010 --> 14:24.700
May we continue.

14:28.230 --> 14:30.230
The thing that has struck
me the most this week

14:30.230 --> 14:32.850
is how wonderful and
wondrous this group of people

14:32.850 --> 14:36.570
is and how magical this event is.

14:36.570 --> 14:38.810
But not from a perspective
of us creating a meta

14:38.810 --> 14:42.000
story for the world,
but from a perspective

14:42.000 --> 14:45.420
of each one of us looking at
our own individual stories.

14:45.420 --> 14:49.550
In personal transformation
we go through a period

14:49.550 --> 14:52.790
where nothing works,
there’s nothing out there,

14:52.790 --> 14:56.170
it’s a total void, we
don’t know where to go.

14:56.170 --> 15:01.130
And now, this is happening at
a collective level in groups.

15:01.130 --> 15:04.440
And we really don’t
have the skills yet

15:04.440 --> 15:08.110
to learn how to
get through that.

15:08.110 --> 15:11.510
But we learned a little
bit at this conference

15:11.510 --> 15:17.080
because on Tuesday night
the whole group broke.

15:17.080 --> 15:21.150
Everybody had different needs,
and wants, and all of this.

15:21.150 --> 15:23.830
And there was an opposition
between the old story

15:23.830 --> 15:26.010
and the new story,
which is going

15:26.010 --> 15:29.610
to be the big
opposition in the world.

15:29.610 --> 15:31.850
There it was, right
in front of us.

15:31.850 --> 15:33.804
[Laughter]

15:33.804 --> 15:36.470
I don’t know if any of you felt
like that in the last few days,

15:36.470 --> 15:45.730
the seeds like—It might have been,

15:45.730 --> 15:49.030
why are they stopping
that woman from speaking?

15:49.030 --> 15:53.660
That is the essential
truth we all need to hear.

15:53.660 --> 15:56.170
Or, simultaneously
in some other part

15:56.170 --> 15:59.920
of the audience someone
saying, why have they

15:59.920 --> 16:02.180
not stopped her yet?

16:10.320 --> 16:14.550
Tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, talk everybody.

16:14.550 --> 16:17.270
And meanwhile, somewhere
else, somebody is thinking,

16:17.270 --> 16:20.640
I wonder what’s for lunch today.

16:20.640 --> 16:24.120
We didn’t do a very good
job of getting through that.

16:24.120 --> 16:28.590
So two nights, two days
later, what happens again?

16:28.590 --> 16:30.790
Another eruption.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.320
Because we have
a situation here.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.930
We came in this
morning with a plan.

16:35.930 --> 16:39.201
What a crazy idea.

16:39.201 --> 16:40.700
We thought, we’ll
just kind of tweak

16:40.700 --> 16:42.370
what we had yesterday
on the agenda,

16:42.370 --> 16:43.953
and then we’ll know
where we’re going.

16:43.953 --> 16:49.050
And then I walk in and go
ah—this is interesting.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.530
This is a little different.

16:50.530 --> 16:52.600
We don’t know.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.930
I’m sitting here, as we say at
Findhorn, my heart is pounding.

16:55.930 --> 16:58.265
I’m really angry that
something suddenly

16:58.265 --> 16:59.750
seems to be taken over.

16:59.750 --> 17:05.150
How many people don’t want to
go to workshops in the format

17:05.150 --> 17:06.367
that we had yesterday?

17:06.367 --> 17:10.579
Who does want to
go into open space?

17:10.579 --> 17:16.829
You know, I’m just seeing,
like, this kind of habitual

17:16.829 --> 17:21.000
internalised acquiescence to,
like, waiting for somebody else

17:21.000 --> 17:22.002
to do it for us.

17:22.002 --> 17:24.460
As Charles said, we don’t need
to wait for permission now.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.835
But of course,
there’s a tendency

17:25.835 --> 17:26.800
to wait for permission.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.230
Anybody who wants to
right now can come down.

17:29.230 --> 17:32.760
Either find the paper you had
yesterday, find a post-it,

17:32.760 --> 17:35.490
write your name, claim a space.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.912
I know it’s been rocky
at times, but I just

17:43.912 --> 17:45.870
want to appreciate our
willingness to, kind of,

17:45.870 --> 17:47.320
flow with what needs to happen.

17:47.320 --> 17:50.280
I think we’ve got to a
reasonable place, a good place,

17:50.280 --> 17:52.860
actually, where a lot
of needs are honoured.

17:52.860 --> 17:59.110
So, I’m going to pass it
to you to close our space.

17:59.110 --> 18:03.630
On the instrument,
unlike pianos and guitars,

18:03.630 --> 18:06.190
all the notes are connected
by the skin of the shell.

18:08.700 --> 18:13.000
So when one note is activated,
the whole shell is vibrating

18:13.000 --> 18:15.890
and it’s connecting with
all the other notes.

18:15.890 --> 18:18.220
And sometimes it
activates the other notes

18:18.220 --> 18:20.940
so I thought it would be
a nice way to come back

18:20.940 --> 18:21.890
into being together.

18:32.260 --> 18:35.330
We didn’t
completely, completely

18:35.330 --> 18:39.590
learn how to do that
in this one meeting.

18:39.590 --> 18:43.660
But I think it’s a skill
set that now facilitators

18:43.660 --> 18:47.420
will be aware—this is going
to happen in all our groups.

18:47.420 --> 18:51.700
Because for real change,
not just small changes,

18:51.700 --> 18:54.560
but major changes,
systemic changes

18:54.560 --> 18:57.060
which are what we
need now—are going

18:57.800 --> 19:01.750
to go through what all
transformations go through.

19:01.750 --> 19:04.730
There’s going to be
chaos, opposition and anger,

19:04.730 --> 19:07.470
but we get through.

19:07.470 --> 19:12.370
And on the other side
is this tremendous joy

19:12.370 --> 19:16.610
of creativity, experimentation.

19:16.610 --> 19:21.610
It is such an exciting
period to be born into.

19:21.610 --> 19:26.110
Never before has a mass
industrial civilization

19:26.110 --> 19:29.380
run on the principles
of interconnectedness,

19:29.380 --> 19:35.450
interbeingness, ecology,
the understanding

19:35.450 --> 19:38.180
that we are all one,
the understanding

19:38.180 --> 19:40.860
that anything we do to
nature we do to ourselves.

19:40.860 --> 19:42.665
That’s all new in our context.

19:42.665 --> 19:45.190
And that’s really what the
new story is about, I think.

19:45.190 --> 19:49.430
And everybody here is exploring
that in a different way.

19:49.430 --> 19:52.445
The new story is going to
be a kaleidoscope of stories.

19:52.445 --> 19:55.960
In every situation
turn pain to hope.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.105
Intimate relationship
with the natural world.

19:58.105 --> 20:00.210
Play—the joy of life.

20:00.210 --> 20:04.720
Live my truth
inside and outside.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.845
The magic that we
have with each other.

20:06.845 --> 20:09.670
New way to do things,
to make things happen.

20:09.670 --> 20:12.990
It’s a bit like jazz.

20:12.990 --> 20:15.780
Recognise and
honour what is there.

20:15.780 --> 20:18.200
It's a spiritual new story.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.560
Every one of us can have
a personal and direct

20:20.560 --> 20:22.160
relationship with the divine.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.370
A new story about stories.

20:24.370 --> 20:26.130
One mind, one heart.

20:26.130 --> 20:29.070
An overriding principle
of first do no harm.

20:29.070 --> 20:32.510
More for you is more for
me, that it’s all shared.

20:32.510 --> 20:34.700
The new story is cow dung.

20:37.622 --> 20:39.510
So many of us
and so many of you

20:39.510 --> 20:43.410
have been working
on the new story

20:43.410 --> 20:45.140
for an enormous amount of time.

20:45.140 --> 20:50.940
That this new story, in
many ways, is not new.

20:50.940 --> 20:55.370
In many ways it is going back
to ancient wisdom and stories

20:55.370 --> 20:57.150
that were known
thousands of years ago.

21:15.940 --> 21:18.510
I believe that
the Western world

21:18.510 --> 21:21.190
is discovering its
role in the co-creation

21:21.190 --> 21:24.040
of a new world on this planet.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.640
We, the indigenous
people, already have it.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.870
We didn’t choose to have
it, we have no choice.

21:29.870 --> 21:37.000
It’s the role that has been left
for us to take on these times.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.710
So our role is to
constantly be a reminder

21:40.710 --> 21:47.790
that we can be one within this,
all the life on this planet.

21:47.790 --> 21:50.770
The honour of having a
seat, having a place,

21:50.770 --> 21:55.360
on that hoop of life, the hoop
of life being all life forms,

21:55.360 --> 21:57.569
and all of us together
make up the hoop.

21:57.569 --> 21:58.610
But we have to uphold it.

21:58.610 --> 22:01.225
If anybody doesn’t uphold
their part of the hoop,

22:01.225 --> 22:04.971
the hoop begins to fall, the
hoop’s integrity is lost.

22:04.971 --> 22:07.470
And so right now I feel like
we’re falling down on that job.

22:07.470 --> 22:09.740
We’re falling down on
the job of holding up

22:09.740 --> 22:11.070
our part of the hoop.

22:11.070 --> 22:13.850
Mother Earth can take
care of the balance

22:13.850 --> 22:17.250
on this planet herself
and she doesn’t really

22:17.250 --> 22:20.510
depend on humanity to do so.

22:20.510 --> 22:24.170
But humanity does need to
harmonise with that transition,

22:24.170 --> 22:27.110
or otherwise it can really
affect our civilizations

22:27.110 --> 22:28.020
and the planet.

22:28.020 --> 22:32.140
We’re, like, in this deep
process of rebirthing ourselves

22:32.140 --> 22:34.340
from a history of colonization.

22:34.340 --> 22:36.454
What did they see
when they came over

22:36.454 --> 22:37.620
and they were looking at us?

22:37.620 --> 22:38.550
What were we doing?

22:38.550 --> 22:39.240
We were singing.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.650
We were dancing.

22:40.650 --> 22:41.690
We were pretending.

22:41.690 --> 22:42.564
We were visioning.

22:42.564 --> 22:44.230
We were seeing things
that they were not

22:44.230 --> 22:47.210
seeing because they
had not developed

22:47.210 --> 22:49.150
those ways of knowing.

22:49.150 --> 22:53.240
And so to them, these are
the activities of children

22:53.240 --> 22:55.980
and even their grown
men are participating

22:55.980 --> 22:58.310
in these childish
activities, which

22:58.310 --> 23:02.270
must make them a very
simple and primitive people.

23:02.270 --> 23:04.660
And I think, it’s
not just about those

23:04.660 --> 23:06.150
that were colonized.

23:06.150 --> 23:09.910
It’s, I think, even more
important for the colonizer,

23:09.910 --> 23:12.140
and those that came
with that history,

23:12.140 --> 23:18.590
to acknowledge the pain in
that, and the hurt in that.

23:18.590 --> 23:19.380
No excuses.

23:19.380 --> 23:21.780
Just the pain and
the hurt in that.

23:21.780 --> 23:25.970
Today still, over
6 million Congolese

23:25.970 --> 23:30.880
have been murdered
in the last 17 years.

23:30.880 --> 23:33.330
Hi, my name is Marie.

23:33.330 --> 23:37.190
My heart is beating really fast.

23:37.190 --> 23:42.650
And I am a woman, a young
woman, and I come from Belgium.

23:42.650 --> 23:45.160
And I want to say sorry.

23:45.160 --> 23:49.485
As my King was
Leopold the Second.

23:49.485 --> 23:56.970
I want to say sorry for
my people to your people.

23:56.970 --> 23:59.020
[Crying] I am sorry.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.575
We are one.

24:01.575 --> 24:03.200
And together
we can heal this.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.270
Let's all hold the
space for a second,

24:05.270 --> 24:08.190
and just notice the reconciliation

24:08.190 --> 24:10.300
inside your heart.

24:27.070 --> 24:30.002
When you’re in harmony,
then there is no fears,

24:30.002 --> 24:36.460
there's no chaos,
there's no worries

24:36.460 --> 24:38.240
about where we are going.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.900
We’re more in harmony with every
transition that is necessary.

24:44.130 --> 24:48.000
From the time we’re
children and all the way

24:48.000 --> 24:52.760
up through our eldership,
we’re encouraging, we’re using,

24:52.760 --> 24:57.270
we’re developing a very broad
spectrum of ways of knowing.

24:57.270 --> 24:59.370
And that includes song,
that includes dance,

24:59.370 --> 25:01.900
that includes creativity.

25:01.900 --> 25:05.140
Dancing and singing for
somebody who is sick,

25:05.140 --> 25:08.790
that is what is my
childhood memory.

25:08.790 --> 25:14.630
When someone is ill,
mentally disturbed,

25:14.630 --> 25:15.860
this person is not locked up.

25:15.860 --> 25:18.130
I mean, this person
stays with the community.

25:18.130 --> 25:24.530
And we organise a big ceremony
during which there are dances,

25:24.530 --> 25:29.450
there is music, and we
believe each one of us

25:29.450 --> 25:31.840
has a sort of sound code bar.

25:33.040 --> 25:36.240
And when we reach
this sound code bar,

25:36.240 --> 25:38.960
then the person will
just go into trance.

25:38.960 --> 25:41.840
And this is really,
really helpful.

25:41.840 --> 25:42.880
And it works.

25:42.880 --> 25:50.020
And many people who go through
this ceremony usually recover.

25:50.020 --> 25:54.000
Because they feel loved, taken
care of by the community,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.310
and I think it’s a way
to support one another.

25:57.310 --> 26:00.280
I think music is
also in our blood.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.750
Rhythm, the same thing.

26:02.750 --> 26:08.700
And I think life is about rhythm
and being in tune with nature.

26:08.700 --> 26:12.210
We made our science
look beautiful.

26:12.210 --> 26:16.070
We mean our science, you
know, weavings, paintings.

26:16.070 --> 26:19.245
And so this is why it gets so
dismissed by Western science.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.750
It’s because they
don’t understand

26:20.750 --> 26:24.040
how to incorporate beauty
into functionality,

26:24.040 --> 26:28.820
into some deep
scientific functionality.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.910
But indigenous
cultures have known

26:30.910 --> 26:33.350
how to put all those
things together.

26:33.350 --> 26:36.660
I think they could see
energy in a way that we

26:36.660 --> 26:40.930
can’t—that these rocks
that they've marked

26:40.930 --> 26:43.174
were very significant.

26:43.174 --> 26:44.840
There are a lot of
theories around this,

26:44.840 --> 26:46.830
but nobody really knows.

26:46.830 --> 26:48.980
It behoves you to
think of everything

26:48.980 --> 26:51.460
in terms of life force.

26:51.460 --> 26:54.990
Not merely an impersonal
force like electricity,

26:54.990 --> 26:57.600
but the manifestation
of a being.

26:57.600 --> 27:03.410
We are as much subtle beings
as we are physical ones.

27:03.410 --> 27:07.280
We inhabit both
ecologies all the time,

27:07.280 --> 27:10.420
though largely unconsciously
in one of them.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.720
These subtle realms,
the energies around us,

27:13.720 --> 27:16.540
are always informing us.

27:16.540 --> 27:19.320
Indigenous people are used
to getting their medicines

27:19.320 --> 27:21.410
from the forest, their
food from the forest,

27:21.410 --> 27:24.030
and they know the forest
more than anybody else.

27:24.030 --> 27:26.550
So to incorporate them in
actually protecting the forests

27:26.550 --> 27:28.940
and being stewards of the
forests, as they’ve been,

27:28.940 --> 27:32.710
and recognising that the people
that are harming the land

27:32.710 --> 27:37.970
are not the indigenous people
that live with a very, very low

27:37.970 --> 27:40.690
minimal effect or
footprint, I would say.

27:40.690 --> 27:42.720
All this philosophy
of ecovillages

27:42.720 --> 27:47.970
is the way we have been
living until very recently.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.640
For thousands and
thousands of years,

27:49.640 --> 27:52.937
these worked sustainably
because it had value.

27:52.937 --> 27:54.770
And maybe my parents,
or my parents' parents

27:54.770 --> 27:55.740
didn’t recognise that.

27:55.740 --> 27:58.819
But now I recognise that
as I’m sitting here.

27:58.819 --> 28:00.360
If you’re going to
live in one place

28:00.360 --> 28:05.500
over an extended period of
time is speaking to a science.

28:05.500 --> 28:09.110
And I believe their
science was thriving life.

28:09.110 --> 28:11.110
And so this is why
I'm—you know,

28:11.110 --> 28:13.230
I'm from an indigenous
people, but I wasn’t, I

28:13.230 --> 28:16.114
didn’t start out my life being
raised from that perspective.

28:16.114 --> 28:17.530
I started out my
life being raised

28:17.530 --> 28:21.530
from an academic perspective,
from the church perspective,

28:21.530 --> 28:23.080
and many of the
dominating forces

28:23.080 --> 28:25.040
of this power over paradigm.

28:25.040 --> 28:28.690
But I’ve made this
shift to go back and try

28:28.690 --> 28:31.820
to understand where my
people are coming from,

28:31.820 --> 28:34.140
what they were thinking
when they were having

28:34.140 --> 28:37.500
this incredible thriving life.

28:37.500 --> 28:40.220
Our culture is
still a matriarchy.

28:40.220 --> 28:43.235
The last of the Polynesians
to be still a matriarchy.

28:46.460 --> 28:49.460
Our mothers guide
us in our lives,

28:49.460 --> 28:54.750
and our grandmothers
are the final word.

28:54.750 --> 29:02.110
The eldest woman in a family
or a clan, or ohana, we say,

29:02.110 --> 29:06.240
is the most precious thing.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.160
Old women are the
flower that never fades.

29:12.210 --> 29:15.160
They are the precious
flower, [Hawaiian].

29:18.090 --> 29:21.100
The older they get, the
more beautiful they get.

29:21.100 --> 29:24.160
Just to give you the
example of my grandmother,

29:24.160 --> 29:27.190
she was a century
and seven years old.

29:29.900 --> 29:34.610
And up to the last minute
she was there, fully present,

29:34.610 --> 29:37.860
joking with us, telling
us stories, teaching us.

29:37.860 --> 29:41.480
And today, unfortunately,
especially in the urban areas,

29:41.480 --> 29:46.590
we have people—the grandmothers are

29:46.590 --> 29:49.420
being replaced by
Facebook, by internet,

29:49.420 --> 29:51.690
which is a sad prospect.

29:51.690 --> 29:56.980
Today our leaders are
actually looking west.

29:56.980 --> 30:01.110
They are emphasising an
education with technology,

30:01.110 --> 30:05.540
and all that kind of thing.

30:05.560 --> 30:08.275
They are talking about
building cities. In Kenya

30:08.275 --> 30:12.870
they are thinking about
building a Las Vegas.

30:12.870 --> 30:16.650
Like, this is not
the way forward.

30:16.650 --> 30:18.310
It’s really the way backwards.

30:18.310 --> 30:23.540
Because these systems in the
West are not working anymore.

30:23.540 --> 30:25.770
But then, those are
the kinds of projects

30:25.770 --> 30:29.510
that have got a lot of
money for corrupt leaders

30:29.510 --> 30:32.190
to actually pocket
for themselves.

30:32.190 --> 30:35.030
Not all our traditions
are also perfect.

30:35.030 --> 30:39.390
I mean, we need to
review them and also

30:39.390 --> 30:41.540
really take the best from it.

30:41.540 --> 30:49.680
And also take the best from the
outside world and move forward.

30:49.680 --> 30:55.450
To be a global family we
need more, not just love,

30:55.450 --> 30:56.830
but we need more trust.

30:56.830 --> 30:58.870
We need more confidence
in each other.

30:58.870 --> 31:00.710
We need to count on each other.

31:00.710 --> 31:03.860
In the indigenous peoples
and in the Western world.

31:03.860 --> 31:06.310
We need to count
with each other,

31:06.310 --> 31:09.940
to be there for each
other at any moment.

31:09.940 --> 31:13.450
There’s a prophecy in our part
of the world in the Americas

31:13.450 --> 31:15.720
that the eagle and the
condor will come together

31:15.720 --> 31:18.580
and that they’ll learn how
to fly in the sky together.

31:18.580 --> 31:25.340
And so this is a song about
that weaving of the Americas

31:25.340 --> 31:27.570
back together into one cloth.

31:27.570 --> 31:31.000
And it feels appropriate to
me at this gathering of our

31:31.000 --> 31:36.580
weaving our cloths back
together as humanity.

31:36.580 --> 31:38.490
So this is a travelling song.

31:42.873 --> 31:45.795
♪ [Singing]

31:51.520 --> 31:58.230
In Bhagavad Gita there are
three important words: yagna,

31:58.230 --> 32:00.430
dhana, tapas.

32:00.430 --> 32:05.270
So yagna is human
nature relationship.

32:05.270 --> 32:10.420
How we live with nature,
because we are nature.

32:10.420 --> 32:14.090
And then we have a second
word which is dhana.

32:14.090 --> 32:19.680
So we not only replenish nature,
we also replenish human society

32:19.680 --> 32:20.570
by giving.

32:20.570 --> 32:22.110
Gift economy.

32:22.110 --> 32:23.310
By sharing.

32:23.310 --> 32:24.340
By receiving.

32:24.340 --> 32:25.350
And by giving.

32:25.350 --> 32:26.430
That’s a dhana.

32:26.430 --> 32:30.070
And the tapas is
replenishment of the self.

32:30.070 --> 32:32.650
So replenishment
of personal energy

32:32.650 --> 32:36.100
through meditation, through
fasting, through solitude,

32:36.100 --> 32:38.150
through caring for yourself.

32:48.170 --> 32:50.150
We are caught in an
inescapable network

32:50.150 --> 32:53.670
of mutuality tied into a
single garment of destiny.

32:53.670 --> 32:57.290
Whatever affects one directly
affects all indirectly.

32:57.290 --> 33:00.150
This is the way our
universe is structured.

33:00.150 --> 33:02.180
We aren’t going to
have peace on Earth

33:02.180 --> 33:05.370
until we recognise this basic
fact of the interrelated

33:05.370 --> 33:07.430
structure of all reality.

33:07.430 --> 33:09.220
So here’s Martin
Luther King who we

33:09.220 --> 33:12.810
think of as an emblematic
icon of social justice,

33:12.810 --> 33:16.220
civil rights, and human rights.

33:16.220 --> 33:18.060
He’s speaking ecologically.

33:18.060 --> 33:19.670
He’s speaking cosmologically.

33:19.670 --> 33:22.650
He’s speaking in terms
of systems thinking.

33:22.650 --> 33:25.630
As they say in
Africa, it’s ubuntu.

33:25.630 --> 33:30.159
I’m only existing
because you’re existing.

33:30.159 --> 33:31.950
Whatever happens to
you is happening to me.

33:31.950 --> 33:34.910
Whatever is happening to the
rainforests is happening to us.

33:34.910 --> 33:36.180
We’re not separate.

33:36.180 --> 33:40.240
When I started in
professional conservation,

33:40.240 --> 33:44.140
the target for
protected areas was 10%.

33:44.140 --> 33:46.450
And if it goes below
a threshold size,

33:46.450 --> 33:48.860
it can’t produce
the life support.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.210
We have a challenge
with climate change.

33:51.210 --> 33:54.890
We have a problem with our soils
now because of overcropping,

33:54.890 --> 33:56.200
using chemicals.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.840
The crucial thing for me
is that as part of that path

33:59.840 --> 34:03.950
we in the West reduce our
impacts to our fair share

34:03.950 --> 34:07.660
and in that journey
enjoy finding love.

34:07.660 --> 34:12.322
The next terrain of slavery
will be in the domain of food.

34:12.322 --> 34:13.739
Because if someone
else determines

34:13.739 --> 34:16.389
what you’re going
to eat, how it is

34:16.389 --> 34:20.969
going to be packaged
in terms of packaging

34:20.969 --> 34:22.590
the seed itself and
the chemicals that

34:22.590 --> 34:28.010
they’re going to put into it so
that it becomes a genetically

34:28.010 --> 34:30.870
modified organism.

34:30.870 --> 34:33.248
Then, people are in trouble.

34:33.248 --> 34:36.210
It doesn’t matter where it
is grown, how it is grown,

34:36.210 --> 34:38.070
as long as it is
packaged in plastic

34:38.070 --> 34:40.780
and put on the
supermarket shelves

34:40.780 --> 34:42.259
and bought as a commodity.

34:42.259 --> 34:44.550
One of the things that I’m
involved with at the moment

34:44.550 --> 34:46.310
is a group called
the Ecological Land

34:46.310 --> 34:48.719
Cooperative which I chair now.

34:48.719 --> 34:55.000
And the approach there is to
raise community finance to buy

34:55.000 --> 34:57.360
land that's currently
in industrial farming

34:57.360 --> 35:00.090
use to build
dwellings on that land

35:00.090 --> 35:02.240
so that it can be
turned into small scale

35:02.240 --> 35:05.570
agroecological growing.

35:05.570 --> 35:08.270
Food is sacred. We have to
be connected with the food.

35:08.270 --> 35:10.590
So we need to be
connected with soil.

35:10.590 --> 35:14.210
We need to be connected with
animals that we take care of.

35:14.210 --> 35:18.260
As if the seals are not
having an unjust experience.

35:18.260 --> 35:21.840
You know, or the dogs
that we keep roped up.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.080
You know what I mean?

35:23.080 --> 35:26.070
We are all experiencing
the injustice.

35:29.990 --> 35:32.390
It’s not just us.

35:32.390 --> 35:34.370
It’s going on everywhere.

35:34.370 --> 35:36.490
My life has become
dedicated to being

35:36.490 --> 35:40.580
a voice for those who aren’t
ordinarily heard by humans.

35:40.580 --> 35:42.800
Personally, I’ve
come to experience

35:42.800 --> 35:44.590
that there is no
other way for people

35:44.590 --> 35:48.200
to care than to have a direct
experience of connection,

35:48.200 --> 35:52.168
or of being again related
with our more wild cousins.

35:55.010 --> 35:59.560
Mostly, I work with humans to
help them reconnect with nature

35:59.560 --> 36:02.040
in a very direct
experiential way,

36:02.040 --> 36:06.400
once again lending an
ear to what is being said

36:06.400 --> 36:09.460
and what’s being reflected to
us by all those other beings

36:09.460 --> 36:11.540
with whom we share the planet.

36:11.540 --> 36:18.490
I wish to bring my voice in
service to frog, and whale,

36:18.490 --> 36:23.780
and wind, and thunder,
and hurricane, and soil,

36:23.780 --> 36:26.880
and coyote.

36:26.880 --> 36:32.240
Not because of their utility
to me as a human being,

36:32.240 --> 36:35.260
but because they are other
nations, other tribes.

36:38.737 --> 36:41.150
This area that
was once a forest

36:41.150 --> 36:46.910
vibrant with wide life,
animals, hippos, crocodiles,

36:46.910 --> 36:48.690
different sorts of
birds, and everything

36:48.690 --> 36:52.270
because it was a thick umbrella.

36:52.270 --> 36:56.690
This forest go into a
complete lunar desert

36:56.690 --> 37:01.060
because, sorry to say that, of
stupid agricultural policies.

37:01.060 --> 37:02.540
I went to a friend’s farm.

37:02.540 --> 37:05.150
She’s got, like,
500 acres of where

37:05.150 --> 37:08.740
they grow organic food
and the soil is depleted.

37:08.740 --> 37:10.220
There’s nothing in it anymore.

37:10.220 --> 37:14.650
The good story is there’s a
village not far from ours which

37:14.650 --> 37:17.070
is called Ijara and
then these people

37:17.070 --> 37:19.900
have reforested millions
of trees around.

37:19.900 --> 37:25.590
So, with two other partners
bought farmland in Oregon

37:25.590 --> 37:27.980
on the convergence
of two rivers.

37:27.980 --> 37:30.900
And then we were just
like learning how

37:30.900 --> 37:32.500
the land dictates what you do.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.260
The fullness of knowing where
the food comes from that’s

37:35.260 --> 37:39.195
on the table, learning how to
empty my own compost toilet,

37:39.195 --> 37:44.770
and to see the beauty of
that, the beauty of that waste

37:44.770 --> 37:47.340
is compost for life.

37:47.340 --> 37:49.950
You have to listen
and, you know,

37:49.950 --> 37:53.390
what happens when you nourish
the soil, and what comes out.

37:53.390 --> 37:55.840
Just, like, the magic of
farming is mind blowing.

37:55.840 --> 38:00.020
So we bought it and basically
gave it to the community

38:00.020 --> 38:02.360
and gave the
opportunity for anyone

38:02.360 --> 38:04.560
who wanted to use it
for something beautiful,

38:04.560 --> 38:07.199
that they could just come
live and create beauty.

38:07.199 --> 38:10.310
The food should be local.

38:10.310 --> 38:12.940
We should participate
in growing the food.

38:12.940 --> 38:14.940
Food should be
organic rather than

38:14.940 --> 38:17.800
these chemical fertilizers,
pesticide, herbicide.

38:17.800 --> 38:21.310
We are looking at how we can
reclaim our traditional seeds,

38:21.310 --> 38:22.302
also.

38:22.302 --> 38:25.278
Have seed banks.

38:25.278 --> 38:27.300
Start growing
permaculturally, which

38:27.300 --> 38:29.440
is how people used to grow,
traditionally, really.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.900
Although now it has
been packaged again.

38:31.900 --> 38:35.660
It’s called permaculture and
it’s being brought back to us.

38:35.660 --> 38:39.567
But that’s how I remember
we used to grow things

38:39.567 --> 38:40.790
with my grandmother.

38:40.790 --> 38:43.210
And this place where we used
to go with my grandmother

38:43.210 --> 38:45.400
used to be called Tiriji.

38:45.400 --> 38:50.820
So I have named my Eco Center
Tiriji, a place of remembering.

39:02.310 --> 39:03.670
I mean, we can solve CO2.

39:03.670 --> 39:04.960
It’s not hard.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.470
But that’s not the
end of the story.

39:06.470 --> 39:08.400
The next crisis will go deeper.

39:08.400 --> 39:12.970
And eventually it will
bring us to a relationship

39:12.970 --> 39:17.338
with nature that is of
mutual honour and respect.

39:25.930 --> 39:28.850
You can call the inner world,
the subtle beings, anything

39:28.850 --> 39:29.500
you want.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.540
It doesn’t make any
difference to me.

39:31.540 --> 39:35.430
But they constitute part
of the greater nature.

39:35.430 --> 39:40.250
And it was just—has been
part of my strong commitment

39:40.250 --> 39:46.230
that by bringing
these other allies in

39:46.230 --> 39:53.210
you could create a
force that we will need.

39:53.210 --> 39:55.920
And then, in fact,
we do need it.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.500
We’re not going to get out
of this environmental mess

39:58.500 --> 40:00.870
by science and policy alone.

40:00.870 --> 40:07.770
It’s very important to start
looking at beyond rationality

40:07.770 --> 40:09.430
to our inner lives.

40:09.430 --> 40:12.160
And this is something
that’s just happening now,

40:12.160 --> 40:16.110
and I hope it hastens up and
it gets faster and faster.

40:16.110 --> 40:20.900
Because we have so much
guidance from an in that

40:20.900 --> 40:23.500
most people do not know about.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.850
And it’s so important.

40:25.850 --> 40:28.800
As a person who's
been communicating

40:28.800 --> 40:32.190
with the subtle worlds
for nearly 70 years,

40:32.190 --> 40:35.040
I naturally see
this collaboration

40:35.040 --> 40:38.500
with non-physical beings
as an integral part

40:38.500 --> 40:41.740
of any planetary story.

40:41.740 --> 40:44.370
Demonstrating the
reality of this

40:44.370 --> 40:47.550
was one of Findhorn’s
original purposes.

40:47.550 --> 40:50.450
At first I didn’t
trust what I received,

40:50.450 --> 40:52.070
and I had to learn
to discriminate

40:52.070 --> 40:56.410
between my normal thoughts and
those coming from my God self.

40:56.410 --> 40:58.420
Eventually I chose
a vegetable that I

40:58.420 --> 41:01.360
liked eating, the garden pea.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.950
I made contact with
my inner divinity

41:03.950 --> 41:07.080
and then focused on the pea.

41:07.080 --> 41:09.900
To my surprise, I
made an immediate link

41:09.900 --> 41:13.990
and received a creative,
helpful response.

41:13.990 --> 41:17.177
Other devas had
an input to offer.

41:17.177 --> 41:18.760
This is an example
from the lily deva.

41:22.970 --> 41:25.110
We feel it’s high
time for you humans

41:25.110 --> 41:27.530
to branch out and
include in your horizons

41:27.530 --> 41:32.780
the different forms of life
which are part of your world.

41:32.780 --> 41:35.620
You have been forcing your
own creations of vibrations

41:35.620 --> 41:39.020
on the world, ones which
are more than strange

41:39.020 --> 41:42.520
and not at all pleasant
to us and to others.

41:42.520 --> 41:44.380
Without taking
into consideration

41:44.380 --> 41:48.430
that all living things are
part of the whole as you were,

41:48.430 --> 41:52.360
put there by divine
plan and purpose.

41:52.360 --> 41:54.830
Just as each soul has
its own contribution

41:54.830 --> 42:00.260
to make to the whole, so has
each plant, each mineral.

42:00.260 --> 42:03.640
No longer should you consider
us as lower forms of life

42:03.640 --> 42:08.090
with no intelligence with
which to communicate.

42:08.090 --> 42:09.780
We got many answers
from the devas

42:09.780 --> 42:11.780
to our gardening
questions, but they never

42:11.780 --> 42:14.500
ordered us to do anything.

42:14.500 --> 42:17.870
The angels, the devas,
or God, whatever word

42:17.870 --> 42:20.670
we are comfortable
using, do not want

42:20.670 --> 42:23.610
us to be obedient servants.

42:23.610 --> 42:27.000
But they want a humanity
attuned to its own wholeness,

42:27.000 --> 42:29.410
and who can cooperate
with them as equals.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.950
Very close to my home we
have the Los Alamos National

42:37.950 --> 42:44.020
Laboratories where the first
atom bomb was dreamed up.

42:48.050 --> 42:52.540
And we had terrible
forest fires.

42:52.540 --> 42:58.790
And the forest fires were coming
very close to this laboratory.

42:58.790 --> 43:02.860
And wanted to get me and my
children out of harm’s way.

43:02.860 --> 43:04.430
What should I do?

43:04.430 --> 43:06.000
I was asking spirit.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.010
And spirit said something
to me. Spirit said,

43:08.010 --> 43:09.470
what do you people want?

43:13.560 --> 43:17.220
What do you people want?

43:17.220 --> 43:19.820
You can have it any
way you want it.

43:19.820 --> 43:27.190
And right now everything you’re
thinking, speaking, feeling,

43:27.190 --> 43:30.970
acting says that you want
to be in the position

43:30.970 --> 43:34.640
where you have 30,000 barrels
of radioactive liquid waste

43:34.640 --> 43:40.160
sitting on a dock with a
forest fire raging up to it.

43:40.160 --> 43:45.910
But if you want something
else, that can be arranged.

43:45.910 --> 43:48.130
Some time ago I
met Fran Stephan

43:48.130 --> 43:52.020
who was a research scientist
for the Environmental Protection

43:52.020 --> 43:55.000
Agency of the US.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.090
And she came to me and
thanked me for my work.

43:58.090 --> 43:59.490
And I thought, what?

43:59.490 --> 44:01.790
The Environmental
Protection Agency?

44:01.790 --> 44:04.960
The story was that she
had been given a job

44:04.960 --> 44:09.110
to find how polluted Puget Sound
is—that’s a body of water

44:09.110 --> 44:14.850
near where I live—and she
kept on for three, four days

44:14.850 --> 44:17.090
and got no indicator species.

44:17.090 --> 44:19.860
And yet she was killing life
all the time getting nowhere,

44:19.860 --> 44:21.800
not even being able to start.

44:21.800 --> 44:23.250
And she was heartsick.

44:23.250 --> 44:24.580
She didn’t want that to happen.

44:24.580 --> 44:26.000
She didn’t know what to do.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.840
So she gave up her own
knowing when she said,

44:28.840 --> 44:31.610
I just need help.

44:31.610 --> 44:32.570
I give up.

44:32.570 --> 44:34.940
And then she heard of
some peculiar place

44:34.940 --> 44:37.450
that said nature
had an intelligence

44:37.450 --> 44:39.770
and that you could ask.

44:39.770 --> 44:45.240
So she, on her last day, she
sat down first and said,

44:45.240 --> 44:48.870
I want to know specifically what
these indicator species are.

44:48.870 --> 44:53.980
So they put down
the net as usual

44:53.980 --> 44:56.590
and it didn’t seem
to fill up at all.

44:56.590 --> 44:59.400
But gradually, they got tired
of it so they pulled it up

44:59.400 --> 45:00.660
and it seemed empty.

45:00.660 --> 45:02.470
And then she looked
at it, in the corner

45:02.470 --> 45:07.050
was nothing but those indicator
species that she’d asked about.

45:07.050 --> 45:09.200
Nothing else.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.690
Well, she didn’t believe it.

45:10.690 --> 45:12.430
It was a miracle.

45:12.430 --> 45:16.310
But they did it again and
the same thing happened,

45:16.310 --> 45:18.825
and she was able to
finish her research.

45:21.950 --> 45:27.800
And to me it’s an idea that the
scientific people of our world

45:27.800 --> 45:29.210
have to be open to ask.

45:29.210 --> 45:31.380
Because many of these
things will be in terms

45:31.380 --> 45:34.640
that I couldn’t put
in because I wouldn’t

45:34.640 --> 45:36.660
have a scientific mind.

45:36.660 --> 45:41.520
But we can get precise
answers from the intelligence

45:41.520 --> 45:42.680
of nature.

45:42.680 --> 45:45.290
In this view the
Earth is itself

45:45.290 --> 45:49.720
a great ecosystem with
two interconnected

45:49.720 --> 45:55.120
and interdependent ecologies,
one of which is material,

45:55.120 --> 45:57.820
and one of which is not.

45:57.820 --> 46:01.290
In fact, I often refer
to the subtle worlds

46:01.290 --> 46:04.270
as Earth’s second ecology.

46:04.270 --> 46:06.210
Before entering
the forest, I feel

46:06.210 --> 46:08.960
I have to ask the
permission of the forest.

46:08.960 --> 46:14.110
Like, dear the
forest, I am a human.

46:14.110 --> 46:18.760
I belong to a species, a
species that is violent,

46:18.760 --> 46:21.410
that is destructive.

46:21.410 --> 46:23.530
And I am not sure if
I deserve to enter

46:23.530 --> 46:26.600
your beautiful territory.

46:26.600 --> 46:29.530
I ask your permission.

46:29.530 --> 46:33.400
And, of course, I receive
very warm welcoming.

46:33.400 --> 46:37.210
For me spending time in
nature is hugely important,

46:37.210 --> 46:42.320
whether that’s swimming in open
water, hiking in mountains,

46:42.320 --> 46:47.450
climbing on snow and ice,
or being in a desert.

46:47.450 --> 46:52.490
There’s something about the
wild places which I find hugely

46:52.490 --> 46:56.660
energising and nurturing.

46:56.660 --> 46:58.480
One of the most
powerful activities

46:58.480 --> 47:00.270
we did with the
teachers was to take

47:00.270 --> 47:02.110
them snorkelling and swimming.

47:02.110 --> 47:04.540
And when they went
underwater, they

47:04.540 --> 47:07.536
were blown away
by what they saw.

47:07.536 --> 47:09.160
They were like, we
didn’t realise there

47:09.160 --> 47:10.910
was so much life underwater.

47:10.910 --> 47:13.840
And so much trash.

47:13.840 --> 47:17.863
And from there, they started
incorporating marine education

47:17.863 --> 47:18.696
in their curriculum.

47:26.270 --> 47:29.910
Saying we must value forests
now because if we don’t we’re

47:29.910 --> 47:31.890
not going to have a
planet to live on,

47:31.890 --> 47:36.340
that’s still saying the value
of nature is for its service

47:36.340 --> 47:38.170
to us.

47:38.170 --> 47:42.101
But what about valuing a forest
on its own terms, because it’s

47:42.101 --> 47:42.600
sacred.

47:42.600 --> 47:45.060
I am an advocate for Earth law.

47:45.060 --> 47:47.340
In particular, one Earth
law that I’m working on

47:47.340 --> 47:52.120
is ecocide law to criminalise
mass damage and destruction

47:52.120 --> 47:53.070
to the Earth.

47:53.070 --> 47:56.080
And to create a
legal duty of care.

47:56.080 --> 48:00.270
And this is about recognising
and upholding the Earth’s right

48:00.270 --> 48:01.490
to life.

48:01.490 --> 48:05.170
And when I say Earth, I
mean all living beings,

48:05.170 --> 48:08.970
human and non-human beings.

48:08.970 --> 48:14.000
I proposed that law into the
United Nations back in 2010

48:14.000 --> 48:16.520
and my life really
did change overnight.

48:16.520 --> 48:19.740
It takes courage to stand
up and speak out and say,

48:19.740 --> 48:23.530
I support ecocide law.

48:23.530 --> 48:27.490
And this is about calling in
support, the support of law

48:27.490 --> 48:30.240
to help those indigenous
communities, those communities

48:30.240 --> 48:33.470
that are most adversely
impacted whether or not

48:33.470 --> 48:38.110
it’s human caused ecocide
through largely corporate

48:38.110 --> 48:40.190
damage and destruction.

48:40.190 --> 48:43.140
Or whether or not it’s naturally
occurring ecocide, rising sea

48:43.140 --> 48:44.670
levels, tsunamis.

48:44.670 --> 48:47.500
The kind of work I’m doing, and
that my colleagues are doing,

48:47.500 --> 48:54.140
requires that people actually go
inside and take responsibility.

48:54.140 --> 48:56.600
It’s not about you, you, you,
you, you, I’m blaming you.

48:56.600 --> 48:58.870
It’s about what have I done?

48:58.870 --> 49:00.930
What can I take
responsibility for?

49:00.930 --> 49:05.650
How can I come to the table as
a person who is impacted by this

49:05.650 --> 49:07.640
and help come up
with a resolution?

49:07.640 --> 49:10.250
This law for the
rights of nature

49:10.250 --> 49:11.740
was actually brought in in Mexico.

49:11.740 --> 49:16.070
They even had, they had
indigenous ceremonies

49:16.070 --> 49:19.210
and they also had a
Tibetan Lama present,

49:19.210 --> 49:21.570
you know, with the town
council, and everybody

49:21.570 --> 49:23.320
sitting in meditation together.

49:23.320 --> 49:28.950
We can choose to regenerate
life wherever we are.

49:28.950 --> 49:30.840
To regenerate ecosystems.

49:30.840 --> 49:31.920
To heal the waters.

49:31.920 --> 49:33.140
To heal the Earth.

49:33.140 --> 49:34.460
To heal the air.

49:34.460 --> 49:37.510
And to heal the plants
and the animals around us.

49:37.510 --> 49:39.070
To heal ourselves.

49:39.070 --> 49:41.630
We have that power
as human beings.

49:53.360 --> 50:00.120
This new story can happen
only if we transform education.

50:00.120 --> 50:02.860
I see the new story
happening in education

50:02.860 --> 50:07.597
where young people are
self-directing themselves

50:07.597 --> 50:09.430
and their own learning,
and they’re actually

50:09.430 --> 50:12.540
realising I don’t need to
go sit in that classroom,

50:12.540 --> 50:14.150
and in that box.

50:14.150 --> 50:18.790
I can take my education and
my learning into my own hands.

50:18.790 --> 50:22.606
So if a teacher, although they have
a lot of knowledge and wisdom

50:22.606 --> 50:25.335
stored up, and information,
if they could approach

50:25.335 --> 50:28.620
a pupil from a tone of
mutual respect, like,

50:28.620 --> 50:31.070
we have lots to learn
from each other.

50:31.070 --> 50:33.520
I will treat you as my equal
throughout this education

50:33.520 --> 50:34.352
process.

50:34.352 --> 50:37.552
And to go off and
support them to do

50:37.552 --> 50:39.510
whatever they want to
do, to give them guidance

50:39.510 --> 50:40.850
if they need it.

50:40.850 --> 50:43.710
To, basically, say if you’re
interested in a topic,

50:43.710 --> 50:46.280
you go off, research it,
discuss it with your peers,

50:46.280 --> 50:50.320
come to a conclusion instead
of giving them the information

50:50.320 --> 50:53.970
and saying, I’m establishing myself
as the superior position,

50:53.970 --> 50:57.200
I have the information and
you learn from me.

50:57.200 --> 50:59.110
Because that’s my
experience of education.

50:59.110 --> 51:01.155
They expect you to
absorb information,

51:01.155 --> 51:04.430
and regurgitate it, and not
take it to another level,

51:04.430 --> 51:06.577
especially, that’s
the basic standard.

51:06.577 --> 51:08.410
And so we need to get
that from each other.

51:08.410 --> 51:11.030
And we need to create these
peer-to-peer networks where

51:11.030 --> 51:12.380
we can learn from each other.

51:12.380 --> 51:14.570
It’s really the
only way that we’re

51:14.570 --> 51:19.010
going to get this very
personal and deep experience

51:19.010 --> 51:21.210
from each person.

51:21.210 --> 51:23.510
Link up schools,

51:23.510 --> 51:28.060
so that my children
in the UK are able to,

51:28.060 --> 51:30.520
through video, and
through the screens,

51:30.520 --> 51:35.222
are able to have a shared lesson
with your children in Brazil.

51:35.222 --> 51:36.930
And they can experience
different worlds.

51:36.930 --> 51:39.500
And they grow up with
that global mindset.

51:39.500 --> 51:45.210
Modern old story education is
de-skilling our young people.

51:45.210 --> 51:49.950
I want new story
education to be skilling

51:49.950 --> 51:53.250
human beings, and young people,
so that they can build a house,

51:53.250 --> 51:54.480
they can grow food.

51:54.480 --> 51:57.250
These are basic needs
of human beings.

51:57.250 --> 52:00.610
Technology and all other
things are icing on the cake.

52:00.610 --> 52:03.800
The real cake is we need food,
we get clothes, we need a house,

52:03.800 --> 52:08.330
and we need to grow good,
organic, wholesome food.

52:08.330 --> 52:12.420
I want to see a new
story education which

52:12.420 --> 52:17.650
is not only about head, not only
about intellectual knowledge,

52:17.650 --> 52:20.550
not only about
measurement, not only

52:20.550 --> 52:23.380
about academic
achievement. It is also

52:23.380 --> 52:30.060
about heart, feelings, emotions,
relationship, love, compassion,

52:30.060 --> 52:32.550
generosity, beauty.

52:32.550 --> 52:34.910
All these values
come from the heart.

52:37.902 --> 52:39.360
It’s just one of
those things it’s

52:39.360 --> 52:43.420
like, we’ve all been on various
experiences kind of like this

52:43.420 --> 52:45.460
but completely
different, obviously.

52:45.460 --> 52:47.560
But this is the first
one that we’ve properly

52:47.560 --> 52:51.870
been on that it’s not
been adults observing.

52:51.870 --> 52:54.420
It’s the raw emotions
there as well.

52:54.420 --> 52:56.200
It’s not the
detachedness of, we’re

52:56.200 --> 52:59.165
going to watch, and find out
what happens with you guys,

52:59.165 --> 53:01.040
we’ve been there, we’ve
done that, it’s fine.

53:01.040 --> 53:01.880
This is a first.

53:01.880 --> 53:02.810
This is a new thing.

53:02.810 --> 53:05.690
And all the emotions
are raw from everybody,

53:05.690 --> 53:06.820
it’s not just us.

53:06.820 --> 53:09.880
And it means a
lot to us for that

53:09.880 --> 53:12.300
and we just want
to say thank you.

53:20.700 --> 53:23.690
I have this idea that keeps
coming round in my head of the fact

53:23.690 --> 53:26.330
that there’s so much knowledge
and wisdom in the, sort of,

53:26.330 --> 53:29.320
elders, and the educators,
and the trainers,

53:29.320 --> 53:32.200
and the mentors in
this whole movement.

53:32.200 --> 53:34.390
And there’s so much
energy in, sort of,

53:34.390 --> 53:36.302
imagination in the young people.

53:36.302 --> 53:37.760
That I’ve, sort
of, got this thing.

53:37.760 --> 53:39.301
I’m like, if we
could just find a way

53:39.301 --> 53:41.530
to really bring
them together, then

53:41.530 --> 53:43.190
it’s like, anything is possible.

53:43.190 --> 53:46.720
And I think today’s
young people are thirsty.

53:46.720 --> 53:49.870
Today’s young people
are starving for elders.

53:49.870 --> 53:53.160
We’re not looking for parents,
we’re looking for grandparents.

53:53.160 --> 53:58.990
We are culturally so starved
of initiation and ceremony

53:58.990 --> 54:04.180
in general, we don’t even really
know what it is, many of us.

54:04.180 --> 54:07.790
My inspiration to help
out the next generation

54:07.790 --> 54:11.800
has been from the profound
wisdom of indigenous cultures

54:11.800 --> 54:14.350
and how they’ve
raised their children.

54:14.350 --> 54:17.080
The environment of
living close to the Earth

54:17.080 --> 54:22.710
has really orchestrated
a seamless and complex

54:22.710 --> 54:26.740
cultural basket for
children to grow up in.

54:26.740 --> 54:31.600
Without adolescent initiation
into responsibility

54:31.600 --> 54:35.620
of what it means to be an
adult, to locate and orient

54:35.620 --> 54:38.500
their values from
the inside out,

54:38.500 --> 54:40.270
we’re going to keep
getting a world driven

54:40.270 --> 54:44.920
by consumption and lack
of long term thinking

54:44.920 --> 54:46.850
for the future generations.

54:46.850 --> 54:50.410
And when we look at adults today
who have not been initiated

54:50.410 --> 54:55.010
into a culture, those adults
can wreak some serious havoc

54:55.010 --> 54:57.380
in the world when
they’re given power,

54:57.380 --> 54:59.055
and we call that
uninitiated behaviour.

55:03.590 --> 55:07.420
The initiatory
experience is a guided

55:07.420 --> 55:11.920
experience by the
community and the elders

55:11.920 --> 55:17.820
to assist that young person
so that they can then,

55:17.820 --> 55:22.540
in a healthy way, take their
place in the mosaic that

55:22.540 --> 55:24.210
is the community.

55:24.210 --> 55:27.900
I was 17 years old, I
left Spain and I landed

55:27.900 --> 55:30.030
in this Findhorn community.

55:30.030 --> 55:33.780
And I found elders around me
that saw something more than

55:33.780 --> 55:36.790
what I thought I should be.

55:36.790 --> 55:40.050
And they fostered
that, so I was lucky.

55:40.050 --> 55:41.680
We’re living in a
culture where we’re

55:41.680 --> 55:45.150
coming of age in a
society where our parents

55:45.150 --> 55:48.506
and our grandparents
haven’t been initiated.

55:48.506 --> 55:53.480
From elder women, they can
learn how to serve, you know.

55:53.480 --> 55:55.640
How to be there for women.

55:55.640 --> 55:58.350
What it is that women want.

55:58.350 --> 56:04.110
But from elder men, I think they
learn to forgive themselves.

56:04.110 --> 56:08.840
Most men I know don’t
actually like women.

56:08.840 --> 56:13.540
They are afraid of
women, actually.

56:13.540 --> 56:16.130
And they disguise
this fear in the way

56:16.130 --> 56:18.720
that men have been
disguising their fear

56:18.720 --> 56:20.400
since the dawn of time.

56:20.400 --> 56:24.272
They puff up their chest like
monkeys and do ooh, ooh, ooh,

56:24.272 --> 56:28.280
ooh, ooh, ooh, get as big as they
can hoping that the woman will

56:28.280 --> 56:30.150
be afraid and run away.

56:30.150 --> 56:34.150
They principally drive
the women in their lives

56:34.150 --> 56:41.800
off and spend the rest of their
waking hours regretting it.

56:41.800 --> 56:48.830
And they all struggle with
both their sexual drives,

56:48.830 --> 56:53.570
and their need to be
mothered, and their need

56:53.570 --> 56:59.450
to present themselves as
if they have no such need.

56:59.450 --> 57:04.460
And it’s this paradoxical
conflict, an inability in them

57:04.460 --> 57:07.620
to see themselves clearly.

57:07.620 --> 57:10.970
And when they cannot
clearly see themselves,

57:10.970 --> 57:14.060
they don’t really
know who to forgive.

57:19.370 --> 57:23.090
See even our brother
raven is accenting

57:23.090 --> 57:25.870
that remark by saying,
yeah, you tell him,

57:25.870 --> 57:29.130
that’s what’s going on.

57:29.130 --> 57:31.060
Indigenous culture
often has the rites

57:31.060 --> 57:33.240
of passage for the young woman.

57:33.240 --> 57:35.760
As soon as she has
her first moon time

57:35.760 --> 57:37.960
she becomes life
bringer, life bearer.

57:37.960 --> 57:42.080
So you are a beautiful
girl who has just

57:42.080 --> 57:46.250
come out of the waters,
come out of this hut,

57:46.250 --> 57:49.002
so you need to show yourself.

57:49.002 --> 57:58.539
♪ [Chanting]

57:58.539 --> 58:00.830
So if you had been instructed
from the very first time

58:00.830 --> 58:02.720
you got your moon
what your capacity

58:02.720 --> 58:06.960
was, what you were able to
do in this life as woman.

58:06.960 --> 58:12.880
It is the power of woman
when she is on her moon time.

58:12.880 --> 58:14.310
That’s where she’s powerful.

58:14.310 --> 58:14.810
I think so.

58:14.810 --> 58:22.490
We need to really make it
a point to appreciate that.

58:30.140 --> 58:36.170
Being heard, being
felt, being seen by men

58:36.170 --> 58:40.690
as your genuine
self, as a woman.

58:40.690 --> 58:47.210
From the very beginning to
be allowed to live in unison,

58:47.210 --> 58:49.970
in one with her blood.

58:49.970 --> 58:53.540
Recognising it, respecting
it, and allowing

58:53.540 --> 58:58.810
it to flow into mother Earth
and again gaining new strength.

58:58.810 --> 59:03.210
Women have been
turned into a material

59:03.210 --> 59:09.460
possession for consumerism,
for consumption, for sales.

59:09.460 --> 59:14.950
Women in my country,
they are so, so oppressed.

59:14.950 --> 59:17.770
The women have a
right to be angry.

59:17.770 --> 59:22.010
They have a right to lash
out at the inequality.

59:22.010 --> 59:26.310
But a smart woman
would rather find a way

59:26.310 --> 59:32.560
to heal the inequality
than to swing the pendulum

59:32.560 --> 59:34.160
in the other direction.

59:34.160 --> 59:37.190
I wanted to help women
to be part of solution.

59:37.190 --> 59:37.870
Not victim.

59:37.870 --> 59:39.530
Not problem.

59:39.530 --> 59:41.990
But to be a part of solution.

59:41.990 --> 59:47.090
We’ve swung one way really
hard in the last few millennia,

59:47.090 --> 59:49.730
you know, where the
masculine is dominating,

59:49.730 --> 59:51.770
the patriarchy, they say.

59:51.770 --> 59:55.610
I just feel inside me
and pray for this pattern

59:55.610 --> 01:00:05.210
to be released of the
macho, dominating, sexually

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:09.290
abusing pattern that
us western males carry.

01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:14.020
A woman in her power,
in her genuineness,

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.190
then there’s nothing
sexier than that.

01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:21.260
And there’s nothing more
appealing than that.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.680
A Sri Yantra reminding
me, someone beautifully

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.220
said, that the initial shift
into the current civilization

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.600
really happened
because of a rift

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.810
between the male and female.

01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:32.440
And that’s what this
symbol represents.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:36.060
I think that both men and
women have a responsibility

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.390
to embody both.

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:41.100
The journey for me is
to keep these two parts

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.590
in communication in my heart.

01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:47.170
The Manish of now knows
there is a man and woman

01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:48.890
inside of him.

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:53.098
I feel I am a man as
much as I am a woman.

01:00:53.098 --> 01:00:56.130
There is no separation.

01:00:56.130 --> 01:01:00.990
There is nothing more
sacred than that union

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.616
between men and women.

01:01:08.062 --> 01:01:12.340
The stars have spent
lifetimes trying

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:16.540
to reach us with the
message that our light can

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:21.860
inspire solar systems
if we let it shine.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:26.370
Like the moon’s reflection
of her sons and daughters,

01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:29.742
great, great
grandfathers and mothers

01:01:29.742 --> 01:01:34.910
foretold this time of great
blessing and slaughter

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:39.490
where we decide between
drought and drowning in water,

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:45.390
or rising like mist from
rivers toxic with dreams.

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:50.080
And give birth to rainwater
and fall pure to the Earth.

01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:00.770
I think that we’re
in a time now,

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:02.380
the very exciting
time, of creating

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.515
a new story and a new culture.

01:02:04.515 --> 01:02:05.890
And I think it’s
something that’s

01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:07.540
happening on a global scale.

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:11.410
It’s the movement
from the 'I' to the 'We'.

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:15.310
Both are necessary, but
where the learning edge is

01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:19.080
is around with
collective groups.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.650
I think that
community is powerful

01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:25.100
when there is a common
vision, and also

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:28.180
when we stay in the
difficult moments

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.740
together and transform them.

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.240
Somehow we have ended
up in a place where

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.730
we are so afraid of
each other and we

01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:41.210
have to so deeply recondition
ourselves to trust each other.

01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:44.270
And communities are the
greenhouses for this trust.

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.260
It’s intimacy.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:50.110
It’s where life comes from.

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:53.670
And it’s not comfortable,
it’s powerful.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.570
Many times we talk
about our culture

01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:59.920
as being based on a
story of separation,

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.120
and community is
a remedy for that.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.320
It is a remedy for
the global disease

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.490
of loneliness and separation.

01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:12.500
A person is another
person’s medicine.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.880
I can say one word is
family, community is family.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.820
One of the biggest reasons
I want to live in community

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:19.765
is for my kids.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:28.110
I think these community
spaces are really

01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:34.300
rich, fertile grounds
for kids to grow up in.

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:57.690
Ecovillages have been very
sustainable in the times

01:03:57.690 --> 01:03:59.780
of economic depression,
just because the hunger

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.800
for community just
becomes bigger.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.330
Within the Global
Ecovillages Network

01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:07.920
then, there is this thinking,
within Africa, within the world

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:13.220
also, about how villages
that exist right now

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:16.340
can actually transition
into ecovillages.

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.140
The previous
government, you know,

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:23.880
decided to turn every other
village into an ecovillage.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.650
So that’s a total of
14,000 ecovillages.

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:29.190
We had a president that
had really big dreams

01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:32.330
for Senegal and for Africa.

01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:36.030
We owe it to the majority
world to get out of fossil fuels

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:37.620
faster.

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.210
Now that requires some
sort of evidence based

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:43.100
rapid decarbonisation plans.

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.675
And it is entirely possible.

01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:53.140
It’s just a question of
having the political will,

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:57.390
and the financial
decisions, and the context,

01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:59.130
the regulatory context.

01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:04.340
We can power down energy
demand by 60% over two decades

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.420
because, firstly, we’re
at an extreme point

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.720
of using far more
energy than we actually

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.610
need for our well-being.

01:05:10.610 --> 01:05:13.900
Carbon neutrality is the
only possible way to go,

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.010
and it’s not my
personal opinion.

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:19.380
It is what the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:23.760
tells us, that we have to get
to global carbon neutrality

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.550
by the second half
of the century.

01:05:25.550 --> 01:05:27.710
The solution isn’t
that someday everybody

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:29.930
is going to move out of
their city to an ecovillage,

01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:30.730
you know.

01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:33.050
But the idea is
that someday what

01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:35.730
has been developed
in the ecovillages

01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:39.477
will be translated
into everywhere.

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:41.810
What I see us doing, what I
see Transition Towns doing,

01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:43.750
is creating a new
cultural story.

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:45.330
And creating it by building it.

01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:48.010
You know, I certainly don’t
want to put down ecovillages

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.050
because they have their
place, and they’re

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:54.157
fantastic examples of
where we might be going,

01:05:54.157 --> 01:05:55.240
and where we might get to.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.000
They’re really inspirational.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.640
But to bring those
ecological concepts,

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.030
ecological and
social technology,

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:07.360
into where most people are
living at this time, I feel,

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.424
is a really crucial piece
of what needs to be done.

01:06:10.424 --> 01:06:11.590
And that’s what we’re doing.

01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:13.006
That’s what
Transition Towns does.

01:06:13.006 --> 01:06:15.881
It says to people, you don’t
have to go away to an ashram

01:06:15.881 --> 01:06:16.380
somewhere.

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.171
You don’t have to go
away to an ecovillage.

01:06:18.171 --> 01:06:22.100
You can just start where you are
now with the people you know,

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:24.032
and start to create
the world you want.

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:37.530
It’s also really important
to have a model for how do we

01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:39.180
collectively discuss issues?

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:40.690
What feels fair?

01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:42.440
Do we want somebody
to be in control?

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.735
Do we not?

01:06:43.735 --> 01:06:48.190
What kind of leadership can
facilitate radical change?

01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:50.369
How do you change
complicated structures?

01:06:50.369 --> 01:06:51.410
That requires leadership.

01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:54.097
It requires managers
who are clever,

01:06:54.097 --> 01:06:55.930
not just from an
intellectual point of view,

01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:57.429
but from an emotional
point of view.

01:06:57.429 --> 01:06:59.090
In the business
work I do, we’re

01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:01.855
working with intensely
top down structures.

01:07:01.855 --> 01:07:04.430
And then I come
to Findhorn which

01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:07.700
is a deep democracy,
bottom up structure.

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:13.390
And it’s much easier to get
something done in a corporation

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:15.180
than it is in a community.

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:19.807
Leadership I think, in the next
phases of humanity, leadership

01:07:19.807 --> 01:07:22.140
is actually coming from a
collective perspective and not

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.210
an individual perspective.

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:26.780
That’s where my
leadership rises from,

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:29.170
out of listening
to what’s happening

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:33.520
in the place, in the people,
in the moment, in the field.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.320
And if my leadership I
really feel will serve,

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.590
I will step forward.

01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:44.540
But if someone else steps
forward and gets moving,

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.200
I celebrate that.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.590
It’s rather like geese flying.

01:07:48.590 --> 01:07:51.510
You know, it’s so much
easier when you fly together

01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:52.640
and then you can step back.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.210
So there’s no one overall
leadership, in fact,

01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:56.490
it’s a shared space.

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.860
You step forward when the
time is right, you step back

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:01.120
and you support the others
who then take the lead.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.814
I bumped into an
individual who works

01:08:02.814 --> 01:08:04.230
for one of the
largest headhunting

01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:07.800
companies, the recruitment
companies, in New York.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.450
So these are the
people who are placing

01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:11.770
the directors and
the chief executives

01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:13.611
into the big companies.

01:08:13.611 --> 01:08:17.252
And I’m on the 25th story
of a tower block in New York

01:08:17.252 --> 01:08:20.910
and I’m talking about what
I believe is the edge in

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:21.899
leadership development.

01:08:21.899 --> 01:08:24.390
I’m talking about how it’s
about personal development,

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:25.836
and he acknowledges me.

01:08:25.836 --> 01:08:31.160
And I’m saying it’s about shadow
work, and he acknowledges me.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.529
And I say it’s about
organisational shadows that

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:36.022
are causing damage to the
world, and he nods even more.

01:08:36.022 --> 01:08:39.492
And I’m at the point where
I kind of feel a tension.

01:08:39.492 --> 01:08:41.700
And it’s about spirituality,
and he says, absolutely.

01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:48.310
But I think there is a style of
collective leadership right now

01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:52.810
that is still coming from this.

01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:58.651
There is not yet enough
of this integrated in us.

01:08:58.651 --> 01:09:03.370
So the style that we see is
still about winning and losing.

01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:05.109
It is not about
a third position.

01:09:05.109 --> 01:09:09.180
It is not about finding, holding
enough the tensions that we

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:10.770
can find the third position.

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:14.179
I think the female style has the
ability to birth the tensions.

01:09:14.179 --> 01:09:18.863
And through the tensions, a
third position comes through.

01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:24.229
The first thing
that has to happen

01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:28.970
is that I have to be
aligned to a purpose that’s

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:32.220
greater than my own
ego, and aligned

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:36.359
to a purpose that’s greater
than the ego of the company.

01:09:36.359 --> 01:09:42.274
Not to seek success,
financial success, or name,

01:09:42.274 --> 01:09:45.790
or fame, or prestige.

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:49.770
Where I have the confidence to
lead into a period of decline,

01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:52.810
and to actually take something
into a cycle of death.

01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:56.280
Because by doing that what
I do, whether it’s me,

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:59.340
or whether it’s my company,
that’s another question,

01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:02.730
I create a space into
which innovation can come.

01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:06.920
And I effectively speed up
the process of evolution.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.740
To seek fulfillment.

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:13.600
Fulfillment of its members.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.190
Fulfillment of the
local community.

01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:18.850
Fulfillment of the
need of the land.

01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:20.330
That is the intention.

01:10:31.642 --> 01:10:38.400
The purpose of
our gathering.... this

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.480
is actually a gathering of
the secret world government.

01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:51.320
There’s a new story for
politics in our time.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.460
It’s not an either/or politics,
it’s a both/and politics.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:11:00.260
It’s a politics of deeply
listening, and collaborating,

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:03.670
and working together on
behalf of the common good.

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:07.330
Where we, the people,
are saying, you know what?

01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:09.816
What do we need
to do differently

01:11:09.816 --> 01:11:15.150
with how we are governing
what we care about?

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:17.140
Lady Rothschild and
the City of London

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:22.970
just sponsored a conference on
inclusive capitalism in London.

01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:25.640
This is a primal scream.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.280
Translated, it means
stop the pitchforks.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.980
That’s another big
challenge that we face,

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:34.750
is when an organisation,
or the power

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:37.750
that can be accumulated
around an organisation,

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:41.510
and there the power is
defined as money—when

01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:44.140
that kind of economic
power is in bed

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:49.320
with the political power, then
what happens to the governing?

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.830
On the West Coast
the billionaires

01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:55.880
in Seattle and Portland,
they’re talking about something

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:58.920
called redemptive capitalism.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:03.330
This is a primal scream
for stop the pitchforks.

01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:06.170
What power is is that
you have a lot of force

01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:06.950
at your disposal.

01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:08.574
You have a lot of
money, you have a lot

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:10.260
of whatever kind of force.

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.310
But these people have no power.

01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:14.750
And I realised this again
when I was in South Africa

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:18.560
just a couple weeks ago
speaking to some MPs there,

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.140
some Members of Parliament.

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:24.170
And I was just struck. Privately
they agreed with everything

01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:28.390
I said, but they felt
helpless to do anything

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:29.440
with this knowledge.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.580
Because their job
description didn’t

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:36.240
allow for that kind of
thing without some kind

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.330
of extraordinary leap of courage.

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:41.640
What’s missing from
the collective dialogue

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.000
is the citizen’s
craft of intelligence.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.030
Intelligence is about
decision support.

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:52.180
It is not about
spying and secrecy.

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:55.800
My national
interest, my security.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:59.190
It's like a human being,
we have personal interest.

01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:02.495
Nations develop this idea
of our national interest,

01:13:02.495 --> 01:13:04.120
and national security,
and therefore we

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.600
go to war for national
security and national interest.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.735
There are no national interests.

01:13:10.735 --> 01:13:14.090
There are only
interests of the Earth.

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:16.490
Interests of whole of humanity.

01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:18.620
We’re totally,
totally disorganised.

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:21.120
There are eight
tribes of information.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:21.890
Academic.

01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:24.680
Civil society, including
labour and religion.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.780
Commerce, especially
small business.

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:29.290
Government, especially local.

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:30.260
Law enforcement.

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:30.820
Media.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:31.490
Military.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:34.290
And non-government non-profits.

01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:37.790
All of them stink at the
craft of intelligence.

01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:39.980
They also don’t
talk to each other.

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:41.480
They don’t talk
across the borders,

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.250
they don’t talk
between organisations,

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:45.490
they don’t talk among
individuals within

01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:49.390
organisations, so one of the
things we have to do is create

01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:51.170
a world brain, as it were.

01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:54.950
But it has to be a deliberative
dialogue world brain.

01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:58.470
I would like to see
all national governments

01:13:58.470 --> 01:14:00.480
be on a pilgrimage.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:06.910
And we are on a pilgrimage
in the service of humanity,

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:08.730
in the service of the Earth.

01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:12.119
And through service to humanity
and service to the Earth,

01:14:12.119 --> 01:14:13.160
we have self-realisation.

01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:33.028
The key is not money.

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:36.840
The key is not money.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.560
Economy is almost the
antithesis of the sacred.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.090
Both because of what it’s
doing to the planet and people,

01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:46.530
and also because it’s kind
of this realm of calculation,

01:14:46.530 --> 01:14:49.390
and utility, and selfishness.

01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:52.960
No company exists
without customers.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.800
So we can blame companies
for changing our diet,

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.800
and making us unhealthy,
and driving up

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.240
obesity and heart disease.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:06.170
But, there’s customers
that choose to buy.

01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:08.260
Those institutions,
the corporations,

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:10.080
are totally human creations.

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.130
Money is totally
a human creation.

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:14.780
I mean, this is the
thing about money,

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:18.286
it has absolutely no existence
outside of the human mind.

01:15:18.286 --> 01:15:21.760
There are far more
senior people on boards

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.400
searching for purpose.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.650
We need to organise starting
that life is the defining

01:15:27.650 --> 01:15:29.210
value.

01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:34.980
And we need to align power
with that value, which

01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:37.960
means aligning power
with living beings

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:41.270
and living communities
that are everywhere local.

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.986
There are people like
you and I who care.

01:15:43.986 --> 01:15:46.360
And they have employees who
look at these things and say,

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:50.142
this is not the world that we
want to help shape and create.

01:15:50.142 --> 01:15:51.850
I’m not suggesting
they’re all like that,

01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:53.433
but there’s certainly
a growing number

01:15:53.433 --> 01:15:55.770
who are thinking
in a different way.

01:15:55.770 --> 01:16:00.410
What we need to do is learn
to meet our own needs locally,

01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:03.080
balance co-productive
relationship

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.400
with our local environment.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:08.050
And that begins to look
like what you guys are doing

01:16:08.050 --> 01:16:11.710
in Findhorn with
your ecovillage,

01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:15.930
using your own resources,
organising community, working

01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:19.274
in co-productive partnership
with nature to meet your needs.

01:16:19.274 --> 01:16:20.690
Now, you don’t
meet all your needs

01:16:20.690 --> 01:16:22.170
so you exchange
with your neighbours

01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:26.130
in a balanced, fair exchange.

01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:27.960
And that ripples
out, ultimately,

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.940
into an interconnected
global economy.

01:16:31.181 --> 01:16:31.940
But one that is
rooted in community

01:16:32.418 --> 01:16:34.330
and organised around
life, rather than one that

01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:38.070
is organised as a
rapacious system

01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:40.582
responsive, predominantly,
to global financial markets.

01:16:40.582 --> 01:16:42.790
I think we’re going to move
to somewhere where there

01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:44.701
is some kind of
balance where there’s

01:16:44.701 --> 01:16:49.220
going to be, say, a yang
based currency system that is

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.850
about exchange and competition.

01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:53.350
But there’s also going
to be a yin based system

01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:55.870
that is more about
cooperation and how

01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:58.010
we can give to each other.

01:16:58.010 --> 01:17:00.920
You get those
foundational ideas and then

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:03.690
the whole frame shifts.

01:17:03.690 --> 01:17:06.203
So, through these three
technologies, the crowd

01:17:06.203 --> 01:17:11.710
funding, the crowd speaking,
and the crowd sourcing,

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:14.110
we’re able to build abundance
in our lives in a way

01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:17.110
that we haven’t
been able to before.

01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:19.340
You know, my good
friend Thom Hartmann

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:22.820
talks about walking
away from the King.

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:25.530
The King is the
all powerful ruler,

01:17:25.530 --> 01:17:27.650
controller of life and death.

01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:31.174
But if all the people walk
away and say, you know,

01:17:31.174 --> 01:17:32.590
we’re not interested
in your game.

01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:34.450
It’s not working for us.

01:17:34.450 --> 01:17:36.710
The King is
absolutely powerless.

01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:39.990
So, whatever way we choose
to transport ourselves,

01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:43.210
to feed ourselves,
to dress ourselves,

01:17:43.210 --> 01:17:47.890
all those have to be understood
as voting with your wallet.

01:17:47.890 --> 01:17:52.750
We haven’t invested in finding
our shared framing story

01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:55.100
that connects all the dots.

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:58.170
The key, to me, is living Earth.

01:17:58.170 --> 01:18:01.400
Earth as a living being.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.660
That’s the foundation.

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:06.760
Sacredness has to infuse
all aspects of our lives,

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.490
including the aspect of
giving and receiving,

01:18:09.490 --> 01:18:11.670
which is really what
economy is about.

01:18:11.670 --> 01:18:15.880
It’s about how we coordinate
our joint creativity

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.160
and how we take
care of each other.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.880
What could be more
sacred than that?

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:23.100
We started a Gift
Culture University, also.

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:25.490
Maybe the first one in
the world like that.

01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:27.980
It’s called Swaraj University.

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:32.640
We have over 250 faculty mentors
who work all in gift culture

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.280
with the University.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.362
I have this habit too,
jumping to, okay, well where’s

01:18:37.362 --> 01:18:38.570
the money going to come from?

01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:40.030
As if that were
the thing that will

01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:42.420
make it possible or impossible.

01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:46.420
When the Foundation decided to
make the summit gift economy,

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:48.310
there were people who
just said, oh, you

01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:49.750
are really stupid to do that.

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:50.880
That will never work.

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.410
People will just
see it as a freebie.

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:57.351
They will exploit this
generosity of spirit.

01:18:57.351 --> 01:18:58.100
They’ll just come.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.560
Nobody will give about the
50 pound commitment fee

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.300
and you will lose
money big time.

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.800
This is just too
huge a risk to take.

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.940
You would be really
stupid to do that.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:10.330
And we did it anyway,
which was really nice.

01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:15.510
But usually I find
that that money issue

01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:19.420
is a way to kind of
validate disempowerment

01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:21.179
that’s coming from
somewhere else.

01:19:21.179 --> 01:19:22.970
And that when you take
that first step then

01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:24.490
the money appears.

01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:28.010
We did tell people what the
base cost rate for us to have

01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:32.560
people here for a week was, and
interestingly, 77% of people

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.130
gave below that base rate.

01:19:35.130 --> 01:19:38.330
But the wonderful thing
is that 8% of the people

01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:42.710
gave 50% of our income, so
they more than covered it.

01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:48.360
So when you offer something
sacred, what’s the right price?

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.470
Any price is too much.

01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:55.420
Because you don’t want
money to be a limitation.

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:56.840
You want to give it.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.630
And of course, the gem in
that is that we would never

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:04.040
have had such a diverse
mixture of the human family

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.440
here had it not
been gift economy.

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.880
The young people
could never have

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:11.060
paid even the base cost rate.

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:13.890
At the same time, any
price is too little.

01:20:13.890 --> 01:20:17.780
Because how do you reduce the
sacred to a finite number?

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:22.910
So, one solution to
this is to give it away.

01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:26.360
Not to say that it’s
free, but it’s my gift.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.130
For us, choosing
the gift economy

01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:33.300
was just a brave experiment
to try a different model.

01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:35.630
And when it’s all
finished and we

01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:38.890
know what our income and
expenditures in all this was,

01:20:38.890 --> 01:20:41.330
I’m going to post this
online so that you can all

01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:44.590
learn from the experiment
and see how it turned out.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:46.800
I mean financially, which
is what a lot of people

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:51.600
are very interested in, we had a
net abundance of £25,000,

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.530
which was fantastic.

01:20:53.530 --> 01:20:56.680
I do believe if we can change
the story, that’s the key.

01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:01.550
Then everything else follows,
and can follow, very rapidly.

01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:04.750
And it was interesting because
one of the gift philanthropists

01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:10.000
said to me, I really want to
take part in this experiment

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.490
because I want to see where
human consciousness is.

01:21:12.490 --> 01:21:16.188
Are we ready for gift economy?

01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:30.800
I would like to start with a
moment of silence because what

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:37.280
I’m going to talk about is a
little bit different territory

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:40.630
because we are going to
look inside ourselves.

01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:44.720
So maybe if you could
just sit comfortably

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:49.000
and connecting with ourselves
and feeling relaxed.

01:21:59.350 --> 01:22:02.411
There is amazing grace
in each one of us.

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:13.080
There is Buddha Nature, which
means the potential to become

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.472
an enlightened being.

01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:20.410
In the most humble sense,
it’s within us, right.

01:22:20.410 --> 01:22:22.471
The seeds are within us already.

01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:29.670
When I go and meditate,
I’m still with myself.

01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:32.588
That’s essential, that, sort
of, listening and receiving.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:41.108
For something new to emerge
we need to make space.

01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:47.580
There is an enormous
potential in the inner path,

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.440
in looking inwards
and finding what’s

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.057
going on inside your
body and inside your mind

01:22:52.057 --> 01:22:53.390
and connecting with your spirit.

01:22:56.030 --> 01:23:00.910
It’s not just solutions out
there, it’s solutions in here.

01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:06.150
We have to transform our
inner worlds so that we

01:23:06.150 --> 01:23:08.465
are at peace with ourselves.

01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:18.940
As we set ourselves free,
we inspire those around us

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:20.290
to be free.

01:23:20.290 --> 01:23:22.264
We know this, Mandela
said it, many people

01:23:22.264 --> 01:23:24.180
have said it in a million
different languages.

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:29.430
Rumi has said it, like, 15,000
years ago it has been said,

01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:31.310
these things have been said.

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:32.970
The first step is
that self mastery

01:23:32.970 --> 01:23:34.290
and that awareness of self.

01:23:34.290 --> 01:23:36.620
Whatever it is that you’re
creating in the world

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:42.295
is going to be coming from a
certain craving, or desire,

01:23:42.295 --> 01:23:47.970
or frustration, or gung ho-ness
that can ultimately be a little

01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:52.090
bit damaging in creating
something that’s very grounded,

01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:55.330
and balanced, and heart
centered, and expansive.

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:56.800
It takes patience.

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.700
It takes self awareness.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.705
As much as I can,
possibly in every moment,

01:24:01.705 --> 01:24:06.660
be present with what is
happening in front of me,

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:10.430
behind me, inside
me, outside me.

01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:13.280
To have the courage to
sit in those places that

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.900
feel uncomfortable
and not immediately

01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:19.080
judge those moments.

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:23.558
And to feel uncomfortable,
it’s a good thing.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:27.960
It’s a good thing to be
able to hold that space.

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:32.430
I’m actually challenging myself
to step out of my comfort zone.

01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:35.960
Because when I do that, that’s
really where the magic happens.

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:39.530
There’s a meaning
to this madness.

01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:42.190
There’s a method
to this madness.

01:24:42.190 --> 01:24:45.840
My identity has been
something that I’ve had

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.830
to figure out as I move along.

01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:51.390
What happened for
me was everything

01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:55.970
started to break down
in my own belief system.

01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:58.747
So once I started to really
question the belief system

01:24:58.747 --> 01:24:59.580
that I’d been given.

01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.630
I was very lost as a person.

01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:03.120
I didn’t really know who I was.

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:05.690
And I went through a
journey of addictions,

01:25:05.690 --> 01:25:06.850
and the psychiatric system.

01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:10.950
And so I had this experience
of, just, a desolation

01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:12.870
of everything that I knew.

01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:16.120
So that fear of the wild,
and the uncontrolled,

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:18.960
and the unpredictable suddenly
became my landscape of,

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.620
like, I don’t
understand anything.

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:26.040
I don’t know where anything
is and what anything means.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:29.210
My name is Jonathan
Standing Bear.

01:25:29.210 --> 01:25:31.610
I feel the grief.

01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:34.970
I will not turn away
from this grief.

01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:39.440
I will welcome this grief.

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:44.530
Tears will often flow, or
they will be there to flow.

01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:46.400
And rather than
allowing that happen,

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.240
we’ll be like, oh
forgive me for crying,

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.130
or we’ll try to damn
them up when exactly

01:25:51.130 --> 01:25:53.200
that’s what’s called for.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:57.360
And it was a
terrifying experience.

01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:02.040
But so wonderful as a, kind
of, training of what it’s like

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:06.770
to be in the unknown, which
is, of course, what life is.

01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:09.216
♪ She has
green dragon eyes.

01:26:09.216 --> 01:26:09.716
She

01:26:09.716 --> 01:26:13.253
can see right to
the heart of things.

01:26:13.253 --> 01:26:18.183
And her body moves with
surprise as though every moment

01:26:18.183 --> 01:26:20.536
were the only one.

01:26:20.536 --> 01:26:24.150
And she’s thirsty for life.

01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:27.526
She knows how to say
no and when to say yes.

01:26:27.526 --> 01:26:29.060
And she’ll give you—

01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.962
Where you think
you’re superior,

01:26:30.962 --> 01:26:32.170
or you think you’re inferior.

01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:38.850
Where you play a game of being
a victim, or being a rescuer,

01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:42.870
or being a persecutor,
pointing at others.

01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:46.650
No, just stopping that
game and realising

01:26:46.650 --> 01:26:55.370
that I’m here because I
was created out of love.

01:26:55.370 --> 01:27:01.414
And I’m here to bring that
love again into the world.

01:27:01.414 --> 01:27:07.756
♪ She knows that she’ll
learn straight from the dragon.

01:27:07.756 --> 01:27:14.700
♪ She knows that deep in the
cave of her motherland.

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:21.644
♪ She knows that no saint with
no sword came to destroy them.

01:27:21.644 --> 01:27:29.100
♪ She knows and she learned
straight from the dragon.

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:31.470
All the anger I felt
and all the hopelessness

01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:34.510
and desperation was not about
others making it better for me,

01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:37.950
but it was about me
healing and finding

01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:41.990
my sense of inner power, and my
sense of empowerment within me.

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:47.277
That pain is always going
to block us from believing.

01:27:47.277 --> 01:27:49.860
And that’s why the pain has to
be cleared, it has to be faced.

01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:52.960
And that’s another reason
why grief is so important.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:58.670
I try not to fight against
the waves of feeling sometimes

01:27:58.670 --> 01:28:00.580
a little bit down,
and introverted,

01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:04.820
and maybe even a
little bit depressed.

01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:08.750
I just embrace those
feelings, as well,

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:13.010
and be aware of what
they want to tell me.

01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:16.150
And out of the doubt
I can create again,

01:28:16.150 --> 01:28:19.900
I can re-decide again
who I am right now

01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:23.770
and what my purpose is.

01:28:23.770 --> 01:28:25.440
It was a very
powerful moment for me

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:30.460
to say enough, no more,
that’s no longer my story.

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:33.190
I choose a very
different story indeed.

01:28:33.190 --> 01:28:36.770
And I choose a story that
goes back to my childhood

01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:38.490
where I really was happy.

01:28:38.490 --> 01:28:43.050
And I choose to seed that energy
instead into what I’m doing.

01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:46.260
Everyone has a gift
to give to the world,

01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:51.510
but we have to remember
that transformation process,

01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:56.650
it’s so wounding.

01:28:56.650 --> 01:29:06.250
And yet, what it brings, the
prize for going through that,

01:29:06.250 --> 01:29:09.860
I can’t even speak
about the difference

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:11.480
that happens in one’s life.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.370
♪ She has
green dragon eyes.

01:29:15.370 --> 01:29:19.060
♪ She can see through the lies.

01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:24.246
♪ She has green dragon eyes.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:38.460
♪ [Chanting]

01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:56.890
We need to build a movement
that connects ecology,

01:29:56.890 --> 01:30:00.630
social justice, and cosmology
using the power of dream,

01:30:00.630 --> 01:30:05.660
the power of story, the power
of art, and the power of action.

01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:09.240
People are always talking about
how do we create a movement?

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:10.690
How do we turn our organisation....

01:30:10.690 --> 01:30:14.030
How do we transition it from an
organisation to a movement?

01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:17.310
This is not something
that one can do.

01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:19.120
It’s not something
that one creates.

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:22.810
A movement creates us.

01:30:22.810 --> 01:30:27.510
It’s something
that we can serve.

01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:29.620
But you can’t make one up.

01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:32.910
If you try, you get
a fake movement.

01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:36.770
A movement is a movement.
It’s something that

01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:42.240
moves on its own, and moves us.

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:46.891
What if I had
nothing to tell you

01:30:46.891 --> 01:30:53.340
and we just stood here
for those seven minutes

01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:56.532
and just be present to
ourselves and to each other.

01:31:31.630 --> 01:31:34.990
We’re facing a
challenge that we

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:38.830
have no idea how to deal with.

01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:41.610
Even if you say, oh,
well, the technologies

01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:45.130
for living sustainably on
Earth are already here.

01:31:45.130 --> 01:31:47.740
All we have to do—well, who is this we?

01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:50.800
We need the perspectives
of different cultures

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:54.460
in order to weave the story
for humanity of the future.

01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:58.020
We are oneness and yet we
speak different languages,

01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:00.530
we see different worlds.

01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:04.540
Our role then becomes
a role of service,

01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:07.220
serving that which
wants to happen,

01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:08.890
that which wants to be born.

01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:13.030
So what I always say to
the young people is this,

01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:14.605
I want you to want your life.

01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:22.230
I want you to want your life.

01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:25.440
You know, it’s not that
you have to, kind of,

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.250
force this thing to happen.

01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:30.160
It wants to happen.

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:33.570
And what I say to
the elders around them

01:32:33.570 --> 01:32:37.690
is I say, how can we ask
them to want their life when

01:32:37.690 --> 01:32:39.770
you don’t want your life?

01:32:40.730 --> 01:32:44.850
One day when they said
to me, our husbands have

01:32:44.850 --> 01:32:46.360
died, how can you help us?

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.980
I said I don’t know
how to help people.

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:52.200
Tell me how you want
to help yourselves.

01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:56.520
And your role is quite
like a baby being born.

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.590
The mother does
most of the work.

01:32:58.590 --> 01:33:02.310
The baby does some through its
struggles, and moving around,

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.340
but the mother does
most of the work.

01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:08.410
The situations that
we perceive as problems

01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:12.690
are actually an opportunity that
we have been given to remember.

01:33:13.890 --> 01:33:16.980
So to the elders in this room
today I want to say to you,

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:20.580
I want you to want your life.

01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:22.780
You gotta want your life.

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:31.580
We have to believe in the
power of our deepest impulses

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:32.720
and inclinations.

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.370
We have to follow the
instincts of our heart.

01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:40.070
It could be something
that’s tiny, seemingly.

01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:41.810
That’s invisible.

01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:45.220
That you could never
say, you could never

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:48.170
rationally explain how this
is going to change the world.

01:33:48.170 --> 01:33:51.530
And the things we can do now
might not be exactly right.

01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:54.662
They might not be able to get us
to where we really need to go,

01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:56.120
but they might be
a stepping stone.

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:57.650
They might get us
part of the way.

01:33:57.650 --> 01:34:01.360
We created the
rubbish exhibition.

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.220
So each group
creating the rubbish

01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:05.898
so it will be like
an exhibition that

01:34:05.898 --> 01:34:09.321
will be displayed in
different parts of their town

01:34:09.321 --> 01:34:12.430
to remind people you have
to be aware of the rubbish.

01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:14.650
In April we purchased
a piece of land

01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:16.620
where we’ll be building
a cultural immersion

01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:18.940
and sustainability
education centre.

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:21.530
Make cow dung soap.

01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:23.410
And we share that
with young people

01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:25.310
and see how much
wisdom—all of our food

01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:30.800
systems, our architectural
structures, our healing

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:36.410
systems, our souls, we’re
connected to cows and cow dung.

01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:39.900
So we make this cow dung soap
which has cow dung in it,

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:44.550
it has a special clay in it,
it has neem, it has aloe vera,

01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:49.810
and it’s a fantastic,
fantastic alternative.

01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:52.930
It’s vital that people
follow their creativity,

01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:54.273
that they follow their heart.

01:34:54.273 --> 01:34:56.940
Our focus is women
living with HIV and AIDS

01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:01.120
and children who have lost
their parents to HIV and AIDS.

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.480
The pain, the
grief that we feel

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:06.410
is what’s going to fuel the
passion that it’s going to take

01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:07.630
to create a better world.

01:35:07.630 --> 01:35:10.980
It’s called Peace Research
Village Middle East

01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:17.460
and me myself with other Israeli
peace activists are the vision

01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:19.560
holders for this vision.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:24.920
And on the streets of Hong Kong
today students and activists

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:29.100
are not stepping down,
they’re stepping up

01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:34.230
and taking on China, the
rising giant of our planet.

01:35:34.230 --> 01:35:36.830
They act in Israel and
we act in Palestine,

01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:39.700
but we are connected
in that vision level.

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:42.790
We came up with the idea of
developing storage cookers

01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:45.630
where a big mass, thermal
mass, of riverbed stone

01:35:45.630 --> 01:35:48.150
could be heated up
during the night.

01:35:48.150 --> 01:35:51.150
And then when people wanted
to boil water in the morning,

01:35:51.150 --> 01:35:53.054
a small fan was
blowing air through it.

01:35:53.054 --> 01:35:54.720
So you could capture
that heat at night,

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:56.730
store it and use
it during the day

01:35:56.730 --> 01:35:58.570
when the hydro wasn’t
available because it

01:35:58.570 --> 01:36:00.445
was powering the lights
in all the buildings.

01:36:00.445 --> 01:36:03.010
Those sorts of little
twists of technology.

01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:05.600
Low tech, appropriate
technology.

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:09.040
We tell kids, we challenge
kids to play superheroes.

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:10.820
So they know that when
they enter the game

01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:12.712
they have to mobilise
their neighbourhood

01:36:12.712 --> 01:36:14.170
to build a sustainable
neighbourhood,

01:36:14.170 --> 01:36:15.794
the neighbourhood
of their dreams,

01:36:15.794 --> 01:36:17.620
to be the oasis in the
whole neighbourhood.

01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:20.000
We need the creativity
of young people.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.630
We need the genius
of young people.

01:36:21.630 --> 01:36:24.000
And we need the leadership
of young people.

01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:28.920
So peace and abundant
blessings, everybody.

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:31.740
Can we please—I invite
you, if you’re breathing,

01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:34.310
I invite you—to just
take a really, really, really

01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:35.996
deep breath.

01:36:35.996 --> 01:36:38.872
[Breathing]

01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:45.080
So what we’ve been able
to do is build a website

01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.450
where we reach
1,000 people a day,

01:36:48.450 --> 01:36:52.000
every day, who are coming
in to learn from us.

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:56.890
We are feeling a call
for building an ecovillage

01:36:56.890 --> 01:36:57.990
in Brazil.

01:36:57.990 --> 01:37:03.060
It will be an experiment and
we’re feeling excited for it.

01:37:03.610 --> 01:37:06.530
We are the middle
children of history,

01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:10.490
coming of age at the
crossroads of civilization.

01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:13.880
A generation rising
between an old world dying,

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:16.200
and a new world being born.

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:19.330
We are the make it or
break it generation.

01:37:19.330 --> 01:37:21.185
The all or nothing generation.

01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.520
There is no shortage of time.

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.570
Time is not an enemy.

01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:36.630
Time is not running out.

01:37:36.630 --> 01:37:38.130
Time is coming.

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:43.700
It’s a journey.

01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:48.310
We’ve been on it for, I don’t
know, 4.5 billion years.

01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:50.760
Let’s not hurry, okay.

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.946
Let’s just be gentle
with each other.

01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:57.940
Ah.... Look around you.

01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:02.770
This is, in part, what
I envision for Alethia.

01:38:02.770 --> 01:38:05.032
I’ve always told
my wife—I don’t

01:38:05.032 --> 01:38:06.740
like to call her my
wife, she’s something

01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:09.810
deeper than that
role—but, I’ve always

01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:15.510
talked to EJ, that’s her
name, about the kind of world

01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:17.860
we would like to see
Alethia grow up in.

01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:19.900
The seven generations
that are coming forward,

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:20.899
that’s how I was raised.

01:38:20.899 --> 01:38:22.336
You think seven
generations ahead.

01:38:22.336 --> 01:38:23.080
Period.

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:27.200
A world where people are
not disrespected because

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:29.100
of the colour of their skin.

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:31.650
Do we have the ability
to let diversity

01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:34.810
reshape our worldview.

01:38:34.810 --> 01:38:37.760
People are not
divided and broken down

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.890
according to social mobility.

01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:41.950
All parties coming
together to talk

01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:44.220
about what is their problem?

01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:45.550
What are their grievances?

01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:47.110
Why they are fighting?

01:38:47.110 --> 01:38:48.010
Talk together.

01:38:48.850 --> 01:38:52.450
Where people are not poor
because of a social arrangement

01:38:52.450 --> 01:38:54.900
that actually
guarantees poverty.

01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:58.200
We can listen to what their
needs are and offer tools

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:01.010
that we happen to have that
they may choose to use, or not

01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:04.510
choose to use, in humility
to say, how can we help?

01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:08.010
You don’t have to do anything
to be worthy to be celebrated.

01:39:08.010 --> 01:39:09.200
You are already celebrated.

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:10.720
You are already beautiful.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:13.830
You don’t have to aspire
to look like Beyonce.

01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:16.210
The change doesn’t really
start with the elites.

01:39:16.210 --> 01:39:18.140
I mean, they’re
more of a symptom.

01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:20.230
They are more of a thermometer.

01:39:20.230 --> 01:39:22.700
A world where she won’t have
to wake up in the morning

01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:25.600
and say, oh my god,
it’s another Monday.

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:28.280
I’m daring to be great.

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:35.110
And I’m inviting you and you
to dare to be great, too.

01:39:35.110 --> 01:39:41.000
Anything that anybody
does that is for life

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.030
automatically makes you a
revolutionary for our species.

01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:51.050
A worldwide collective,
so that we begin to talk

01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:55.600

the interconnection of all.
