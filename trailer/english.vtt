NOTE Paragraph

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.580
The world is the
way it is today

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.085
because of the stories we have
communicated to each other.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:13.280
Every culture has
a mythology that

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.630
answers the basic
questions - who are you?

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.720
What is a human being?

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.410
What's important in life?

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.734
How does change
happen in the world?

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:21.650
Where do we come from?

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.360
Where are we going?

00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:36.470
One of the problems
with the old story

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.240
within Western
culture is that it's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.220
perpetuated a
sense of separation

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.610
between humans and the planet.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.052
We are putting so much
pressure on the environment,

00:00:45.052 --> 00:00:47.800
so much pressure on
poor people, so much

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.335
pressure on the atmosphere.

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:53.580
Never before has a mass
industrial civilization

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.960
run on the principles
of interconnectedness.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.630
We need the perspectives of
different cultures in order

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.665
to weave the story for
humanity of the future,

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:06.910
not try to reach a single
story, but figure out -

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.520
what are our common values?

00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:12.620
♪ Whatever your political party

00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:17.792
♪ or whatever the colour of your skin

00:01:18.884 --> 00:01:21.610
♪ we are all in this together

00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:27.758
♪ and only together can we do something

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.930
The Western world is
discovering its role

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.810
on the co-creation of a
new world on this planet.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.410
For real change,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.010
not just small
changes but major changes,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.370
systemic changes.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.290
We have the
collective intelligence

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.840
to create all the
solutions we might need.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.420
It's not just
solutions out there.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.620
It's solutions in here.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.480
We're not going to get out
of this environmental mess

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.080
by science and policy alone.

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.042
♪ We are all in this together

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:05.298
♪ and only together can we do something

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.610
We need to build a movement
that connects ecology,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.470
social justice, and cosmology
using the power of dream,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.670
the power of story, the power
of art, and the power of action.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.590
Anything that anybody
does that is for life

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.720
automatically makes you a
revolutionary for our species.

00:02:29.906 --> 00:02:33.635
♪ Well come on now, well it's time,

00:02:33.728 --> 00:02:36.618
♪ it's time to care for Earth
