# Subtitles for the New Story Film

## Introduction
The film _An Enquiry into A New Story for Humanity, Change the Story, Change the World_ was released in 2016 and was inspired by the [New Story Summit](http://newstoryhub.com) at the [Findhorn Foundation](https://www.findhorn.org): a sold-out multicultural, multigenerational enquiry into a new story for humanity, attended by change makers and activists from over 50 countries. A number of professional filmmakers gifted their skills during the summit and conducted a series of interviews with key speakers, each carrying a thread of the new story.

The feature length film brings together excerpts from some of these inspiring interviews, along with key moments from the summit itself. It is intended as a tool to inspire and inform, to foster further enquiry, and to serve as a call to action in service to a better world.

In order to make the film accessible to as many people as possible, volunteers around the world are translating the English language subtitles for the film.

This repository holds all currently available subtitles.

For more information about the film, and to watch it free online, please visit the [New Story Hub website](http://newstoryhub.com/film/).

## Download subtitle files to use when viewing the film

Please note that if you are streaming the film from our website you do not need to download subtitles. Just select the appropriate subtitles by clicking the `CC` button on the right hand side of the video play toolbar.

To download the subtitles [please download this file](https://github.com/findhorn/newstoryfilm-subtitles/archive/master.zip) to your computer and unzip it. You will find all currently available subtitle translations in the 'translations' folder.

Subtitles are all in _WebVTT_ format. If you need subtitle files in a different format please convert the file. There are many online converters, such as [this one](https://gotranscript.com/subtitle-converter) or [this one](http://www.3playmedia.com/services-features/free-tools/captions-format-converter/).

## Submit edits and corrections to any subtitles

It would be a great help to us if you could edit the original subtitle file and make any corrections directly in the file. To do that, please follow the instructions in the section _Translating the subtitles_ below for how best to do this.

If you are unable to edit the files directly, please [view the appropriate subtitle file on the web](https://github.com/findhorn/newstoryfilm-subtitles/blob/master/translations/) and write to us with the line number(s) in the subtitle file which need corrected and your proposed correction. Please try to be as clear as possible about what needs changed as it can be hard to know what to change if we don't speak that language!


## Translating the subtitles

Before you start translating, please [check with us](http://newstoryhub.com/contact/?type=nsfilm) to make sure someone else hasn't already started a translation in your language!

When you are ready to start, first please [please download the subtitle files](https://github.com/findhorn/newstoryfilm-subtitles/archive/master.zip). Unzip the file, and use the English language subtitles (`english.vtt`) as your starting point in the following steps.

In order to edit the subtitles, you can either:

1. use a subtitle editor application
2. use a simple text editor

### Using a subtitle editor
Using a subtitle editor takes a little time to learn, but has many advantages and makes it easy to edit subtitles with the film synchronised to exactly what you are editing. [Amara provides a free online subtitle editor](https://www.amara.org) which we used to create the original English language subtitle file.

Open the `english.vtt` file in Amara or other subtitle editor and begin your translation. When you have finished, please save your translation as a `.vtt` file and email it back to us. Please also note the guidelines in the section _Subtitle guidelines_ below.

### Using a text editor
If you prefer to use a text editor:

* if necessary to open the file, you can change the file extension from `.vtt` to `.txt`.
* please edit the file in a plain text editor (not e.g. Microsoft Word, Open Office or similar), and save the file as plain text (.txt) with UTF-8 or UTF-16 character encoding.
* if you are in any doubt, you can download for free a suitable text editor (for Windows, Mac or Linux) from https://www.sublimetext.com/3.
* replace the English words with your translation - do not leave the English lines in place once you have translated them.
* do not edit any of the time codes and be careful not to add any spaces or other characters to the timecode lines.
* any & symbols in the text must be represented as `&amp;`.
* each time code must not have more than 2 lines of text and must be followed by a single blank line (even a single space in the blank lines will break the subtitles).

When you have finished translating, it would be helpful if you could check that your translation is in the correct format by copying and pasting the entire translated subtitle file into the [subtitle validator on this website](https://quuz.org/webvtt/). If the validator reports any errors it would be very helpful if you could try to fix them before sending the subtitles back to us. However, if you are unable to do so, we will do our best to fix them.

When you are ready, please rename the subtitle file (e.g. with the language you have translated into) and email the file back to us.

## Subtitle guidlines
* lines should not be longer than 42 characters - if lines are too long it makes the subtitles hard to read.
* please try to stick as close to the English subtitles as possible, subtitle by subtitle. However, if it is necessary to change the order slightly, or break a sentence between two subtitles differently from the originals, that's fine too.
* if you are unable to translate any subtitles for any reason, please leave the original English subtitles in place.
* be sure to add your name to the subtitle credits at the very end!
